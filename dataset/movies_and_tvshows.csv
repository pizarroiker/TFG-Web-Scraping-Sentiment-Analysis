I really enjoyed the behind-the-scenes footage too, it feels great seeing Beyoncé putting it all together, as the superior artist she is, while praising all the crew that worked so hard for this tour. They truly created a supermachine. It never stops to amaze me how she always comes up with new stuff and manages to top everything she has done before.

Her work ethic and attention to detail showcased throughout the WHOLE FILM was inspiring. This movie has everything; I laughed, was in awe, and even teared up at parts. The montage about UNCLE JOHNNY was so heartfelt and touching; the fact that he isn't on this earth to see what Beyoncé has created in his honor is heartbreaking. Seeing this with my Mom, who I went to see Beyoncé with as well, was so important. The message about being a mom and being there for your children was so beautiful and made me so thankful that I got to experience this whole thing with my Mom. The editing and soundscape for this film was on a whole new level. The constant cuts to different outfits, the loud bass, and the hundreds of different camera angles made it a whole different experience compared to the concert. It is obvious to me that Beyoncé is the greatest living entertainer of our time and that NO ONE is on her level. The fact that she was so involved in every single aspect of this tour and movie is so impressive. She truly created a film and tour that uplifts everybody and did it in a way that looks BREATHTAKING on screen and in person.

Beyonce's stamina and technical skills as a singer and dancer are beyond reproach and are fun to see. It's also refreshing to see an artist involved in every element of a show's production whereas she could surely pass a lot of duties to others. The sheer spectacle and fun of the concert comes to a grinding halt however during many of the documentary portions. Beyonce represents the American ethos of self-assured individualism about as well anyone in this film and it's hard to not feel that her approach to work sometimes veers into self-aggrandizement. It's wonderful to see the work of her many collaborators but did we also really need to see Beyonce overriding and belittling their advice? The implication in these sequences is that she is consistently combatting laziness, corner cutters and compromisers. She alone can do it. In the era of strongman politicians and megalomaniacal billionaires, is this really what we need to see? Beyonce addresses her take no guff attitude head one in at least one voiceover, saying it doesn't preclude empathy.

By weaving in behind-the-scenes footage and interviews that reveal where Renaissance came from and how it got to be here, Beyoncé serves up a fully satisfying meal.'), (9.0, 'It’s a celebration of talent, yes, but also of the commitment, the sacrifice, the sheer tenacity required to pull off the illusion of effortlessness.'), (9.1, 'Beyoncé wants to show you the work, the grit, the ingenuity. She wants to show you, as she repeats, her renaissance.'), (8.3, 'The movie — and maybe Beyoncé’s life — is a constant negotiation between giving viewers that perfect show they crave and these moments of spontaneity. “Renaissance” as a whole sometimes struggles to find that balance, as it moves through all of its different and equally intriguing ideas.

She is the closest thing to perfection, a once-in-a-lifetime talent. But what’s made her so spectacular to us is, privately, exhausting. Renaissance is the merging of the two, showing us the sheer amount of determination and work it takes to produce a show like Renaissance, and the toll it takes on the very human woman behind it all.'), (9.0, 'Beyoncé’s Renaissance is so much more than a concert film. It’s a superhero epic—as if Bey is filling the void left by The Marvels or Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania. It’s a glorious three-hour tour of the Queen in all her creative splendor, on her record-setting Renaissance World Tour from this past summer.'), (10.0, 'Renaissance: A Film by Beyoncé is as much a work of art as the monolithic concert production itself.

Beyoncé has much to be thankful for and she spends a little too long doing the thanking, from her parents to her dancers to guests like Diana Ross. But there’s always another slab of concert action round the corner to jolt the whole show back to life.'), (10.0, 'The film — written, directed and produced by Beyoncé — perfectly captures her dazzling performances for the big screen and somewhat unveils intimate behind-the-scenes footage from a normally private singer, who has rarely done interviews in the past decade.'), (10.0, 'Renaissance: A Film by Beyoncé is a true odyssey, a maximalist explosion of sparkles and beats and visuals and insight.')}"
Past Lives,"Jun 2, 2023",movie,1 h 45 m,9.4,8.2,"['Drama', 'Drama']",8.6,"{('10', 'Writer/Director Celine Song has used her own life story to craft 2023’s best film so far. Nora is twelve years old and has a crush on her classmate Hae Song. Unfortunately for the burgeoning romance, Nora’s parents have decided to leave Seoul and immigrate to Canada. Twelve years later, Nora and Hae Song reconnect through the miracle of social media. Their relationship becomes a series of video calls where the sense of connection is palpable. Eventually though, Nora decides that they should stop talking for a while; she wants to focus on career opportunities in her new home town of New York City. Another twelve years later, Hae Song decides to vacation in New York City. It’s an opportunity for him to see a now-married Nora face-to-face for the first time in twenty-four years. It’s all sweet, sad and thoughtful. In the process, this film offers more observations about the human condition than any film in recent memory. Several elements make this film outstanding. The cast is pitch perfect. As the adult Nora, Greta Lee (“The Morning Show,” “Russian Doll,” Will Aronson’s musical “My Scary Girl”) is mesmerizing. She blends her well-honed comic timing with a sincerity and vulnerability that are irresistible. As Hae Song, Teo Yoo (“Leto,” “Decision to Leave”) is equally impressive. You can often read his emotions without a word having to be spoken. John Magaro (“The Big Short,” “First Cow”) has a smaller but still essential role as Nora’s husband, Arthur. In one of the best film scenes in recent memory, Nora and Hae Song are in a bar speaking in animated Korean while Arthur sits patiently, uncomfortably beside her. Clearly, this is a film that could have gone in a million different directions. Song deftly uses her story to explore a variety of themes – the nature of relationships, the immigrant experience, the necessary balance between work and relationships, the role of fate (and the Korean concept of “in-yun”). She does it all in an unhurried style that makes “Past Lives” feel similar to Richard Linklater’s “Before” trilogy. It’s my guess this film will be equally well-loved and critically regarded. What’s most surprising here is Song’s self-confidence as a first-time filmmaker, given that she has the additional responsibility of being true to her own story. Many of the story elements of “Past Lives” are autobiographical. Song emigrated from Korea to Canada at age 12. She, like Nora, is a playwright. She currently lives in New York City with a husband she met on a writer’s retreat, like her character. Realizing and respecting the power of her story, Song infuses this film with an unhurried pace that allows real emotions to develop and well-earned insights to come to the surface. Song has the self-confidence to highlight the power of words left unspoken. She uses her technique to convey the insurmountable gulf between two characters who, paradoxically, are standing two feet apart. Like many of the best films, “Past Lives” will serve as an incentive for self-reflection for many moviegoers. You’ll leave the theater pondering the arc of your own story and the crucial “what-ifs” that have affected your own journey. “Past Lives” is a powerful, evocative experience for any moviegoer with a beating heart.'), ('9', 'Beautifully crafted and filmed movie that touches on chance encounters as well as meaningful exchanges that alter the course of our lives but occasionally we can reflect back on without remorse. Well cast.'), ('7', 'The actors ooze charisma and they are well served by sharp writing in this story of reconnecting with childhood crushes.

What I liked about this movie is that it left a lot to the viewers imagination. Wil they or won't they? A lot of feelings are left unsaid, but you can see it in the body language. I loved the pace of the movie. It kind of reminds of the Before Sunrise trilogy in that you want to know how their live turned out. Maybe there will be a sequel.... I hope so.""), ('10', 'Watching this deeply personal and meditative film will go down as one of the very best moviegoing experiences I have enjoyed in recent years.

Suspicions about his death lead to accusations of his wife (Sandra Hüller). After some preliminary setups, much of the film takes place in the courtroom where the trial is played out. Traditionally, this could be a trite or tedious encounter, but the case becomes as much about the couple's conflicted relationship as it does the death. Hüller creates a complex character, while Graner brings depth to his struggle. In addition to solid performances, co-writer/director Justine Triet elevates what could have been dull cross-examinations into a continually compelling drama.

It’s an expertly crafted courtroom drama, and a gripping emotional story. Film buffs, be sure to add this to your watchlist, it’s a 2023 film not to be missed. Sandra (Sandra Hüller), her husband Samuel (Samuel Theis) and their son Daniel (Milo Machado Graner) live in a remote town in the French Alps. Their house is in a picturesque but very secluded location. When Samuel is found dead in the snow the police start their investigation and they quickly begin to question whether he was murdered or if he committed suicide. Sandra becomes the main suspect and a court case that initially appears as “did she really kill her husband?” goes much, much deeper. Delving headfirst into their complicated marriage, scrutinising every detail under the legal system and putting it on display for everyone to see. Anatomy of a Fall is part murder mystery, part courtroom drama and all tense crime thriller. It’s a brilliantly written story that gradually reels you in and will keep you guessing until the very end. It brings you on a psychological journey from start to finish and deals with complex relationships and how events and conversations can be interpreted. It’s so realistic and engrossing and at times feels like a true crime story. The details of the case are revealed piece by piece like a jigsaw puzzle while very effectively making you feel like you’re right there sitting in the courtroom watching the events unfold. Courtroom dramas are generally crowd pleasers, although many go way beyond reality. Anatomy of a Fall feels so genuine and chilling. Not going for the shouty outbursts or shock value, it moves along at a slow pace while also packed full of emotion from Sandra Hüller every second she’s on screen. As the viewer you’re right there in the middle of it, unsure whether she did or didn’t do it. A film that relies mainly on conversations needs a great script and the right people for the roles. Sandra Hüller as the widow standing trial and Milo Machado Graner as her son are two of the best performances I’ve seen all year. It’s all tied together with a captivating script and the whole film is a lesson on how to make a courtroom drama. Anatomy of a Fall is a gripping and engaging film by Justine Triet.

With her young blind son as the only witness, she must defend herself while also coming to terms with her past with her late husband and her relationship with her son. Directed by Justine Triet, this French film is at first glance a rather typical courtroom procedural drama. And while this is rather true in some senses, it also takes some interesting and unexpected turns, particularly in the latter half of the film as things become more clear and apparent with the trial and everything leading up to it. And while I felt as though it played things relatively safe and pedestrian for the most part, the story remains compelling enough in its own right, and Huller gives an absolute tour de force performance here. Even the young boy playing her son here also has some solid moments to shine in the film's second half in particular. Overall, it's a rather standard courtroom procedural, but some of the unexpected turns it takes midway through, along with the stellar performances from all involved make this one a worthwhile enough watch.

Like many other Scorsese films, Killers of the Flower Moon explores how evil emerges in a family community and takes control of men\'s actions. Different from other Scorsese films however, the pace doesn\'t accelerate as the film progresses. If anything, it seems to slow down: months and even years seem to go by in the first thirty minutes of the film, while a few days capture the last hour. It seems like historic Scorsese films like The Age of Innocence, Gangs of New York, Silence and this film share the characteristic of a steady, calmer pace, as if the distance of time allowed for a more balanced approach to the material. Running at three and a half hours without the entertaining excesses of Goodfellas or the Wolf of Wall Street, it is not surprising that the film has delivered mixed results at the box office. And yet it\'s as relevant, engaging and disturbing as any other Scorsese film. The film doesn\'t hide its societal point of view, and addresses head on the topic of repression of Native Americans by white populations in American history in the most unequivocal of ways. But running as an undercurrent throughout the film lies another of today\'s hot topics, which is the right of representation (understood as the right to represent something in art, or in this case on the screen). Who is Martin Scorsese to make a film about the abuses to Native Americans by white men? Is it okay that he made the film with the main characters and actors being two white men? Scorsese states in a pre-roll shown before the start of the film that its story was of particular ""personal relevance"" to him. In what way? In making Killers of the Flower Moon, Scorsese states that repression of any person or population is never someone else\'s problem. It\'s ours, and should feel personal to all of us. Representing it on screen is not stealing someone else\'s rights, but on the contrary opening ourselves to the pain of others. That possibility of understanding a different human group, for a filmmaker who made his fame and fortune focusing narrowly on his native New York, is the ultimate theme of the film. Killers of the Flower is masterfully directed by Martin Scorsese and brilliantly acted by Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro and Lily Gladstone. One can only be in awe at how every shot, every camera movement has a purpose, contributes to the story and reminds you of how great an art filmmaking can be. Every scene that Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro are together on is like an acting masterclass. It is a luxury to see these two great actors playing together.'), ('7', ""An inflated movie by a the heavyweight name of Martin Scorsese.

There’s no fun, no suspense, just agony and bad men. Written, directed, shot, and produced by white folks, this is a film about white men murdering Indigenous women and men. The spectacle of suffering lasts 3.5 hours. Who is this film for? Why was this movie about Leo and Deniro? Scorcese’s choice to focus the story on the “tortured soul” of a dimwitted man and his manipulative genocidal uncle is a destructive waste of time and possibilities. I wonder - what could have this film been with one Indigenous person involved in a leading creative role? There is something much more profound rumbling beneath this Hollywood interpretation of history. Lily Gladstone and every Indigenous actor in this film are stones washing ashore in a storm. They shine, and make the most when given sips of air to breath, offering respite from torture with grace, humility, edge, and spirit. Gladstone’s undoubtedly complex, yet unrealized character Molly is still relegated to a filmmaker afterthought. The Osage people are treated as dogs, poisoned, shot, and do basically nothing to look into how their people are dying. How is this entertainment or helpful to ending the cycle of colonization and stigmatization of Indigenous people as victims? I understand the Osage people hope it is helpful to their people and gets the story out, but, I just don't know. You can tell there is something off when filmmakers feel the need to open their film with a personal disclaimer about how much they wanted to make a movie, and then close it with themselves. Why bookend yourself? How positively “elite” critics have received this film is unsurprising. It's just not that good of a film. As we all know, it is long, yet flaccidly paced. Not a good combo.

BUT. The rest of the movie has pacing issues everywhere. The first 50 minutes of the film is *very* loaded with dialogue (not exactly this series\' strong suit) and the latter half of the film is *very* loaded with action. Some cool action, to be sure, but often sequences that just go on and on — looking at you ""John falls down stairs for 45 seconds"". Bill Skarsgard is a great actor but his dialogue is so mediocre you won\'t love him or hate him, you\'ll probably just forget he existed after the credits role. Donny Yen as Caine is slick as all hell, moves like he\'s still in his prime. There\'s a strange fat german fellow who is very obviously a guy in a fat suit. He chews the scenery so hard he is somewhat entertaining but at 2 hours and 49 minutes long you could\'ve easily cut his section of the film and no one would notice. All in all, lots of nice moments, even little nicely written character moments as well. But at nearly 3 hours long and with pacing problems you\'re not gonna be on the edge of your seat the entire time. Easily the most disappointing in the series.

The Holdovers,"Oct 27, 2023",movie,2 h 13 m,8.2,7.7,"['Comedy', 'Comedy']",7.8,"{('10', 'Pure cinematic nostalgia. I was reminded of a time in life; my version of these events. Payne makes coming-of-age stories about grown ups. As if there were an important basic childhood lesson that was missed, which creates a hole that needs to get smoothed over. Since this movie is set over the holidays, we have our Scrooge character and then we have various archetypes, or values, presented by other characters. Do we have more in common with others that we thought? Are we missing out on friendships right under our nose? Is life about adjusting to certain discomforts or radically rejecting them until we achieve satisfaction? There are some profound moments in the film, and they are all deftly handled with a lot of organic breathing room given to the actors to feel out the scene. The beautiful production design (including the choices of camera, film (?), color) sets the stage for the actors to really step into the shoes of the characters. All the performances are good and memorable down to the smallest part. That’s all I would need to say about the direction. The script is fantastic. I haven’t read it, but it feels brought to life accurately. I can feel the script in the film but not in a stuffy way. It has structure, pathos and great little moments that are brought to life through creative interpretation. It feels like a well considered film, neither too far a drama or a comedy; as Dramedies go I’d say it’s 50/50. Many moments are fun and poignant at the same time. I expect The Holdovers to be even more poignant on second viewing now knowing the characters’ full arcs. What impresses me so much about the characters is that they arrive fully formed, they are fully formed throughout, and it ends with them fully formed. Yes there is character growth, but it’s that character growing, not being re-written into someone they weren’t already to begin with. The actors are given a lot of bandwidth to continually bring out different aspects of their characters so nothing feels out of place later whether it’s an aggression or a kindness. Someone can be harsh in one moment, and nice to someone in the next. That’s what life is like. There’s not a firm line between “hero” and “villain” like in many works of fiction. Everyone is the “hero” of their own journey, but sometimes they took an arrow without realizing it. And not until they stop blindly moving forward (or half blind?) for a holiday break can they realize where damage was done, pull out the arrow, and make the necessary adjustments to turn the next page of their hero’s journey. The Holdovers is a beautifully story, well told, and a reminder that the scope of a film can be epic even in small moments as long as we understand who the characters are and their choices have weight. 9.5/10'), ('6', 'Heartwarming films for the holidays are something we’re all supposed to love, right? Well, if you’re talking about the works of directors like Frank Capra, George Seaton, Michael Curtiz and Chris Columbus, you’d be correct. But, since it’s been so long since we’ve had releases of that quality, in recent years, viewers hungry for such movies have been glomming on to anything that even remotely approaches such titles, whether or not the accolades are deserved. And that, in my view, sums up my feelings on the much-celebrated new feature from director Alexander Payne. This tale of a curmudgeonly, condescending, middle-aged, fuss-budget prep school teacher (Paul Giamatti) assigned to babysit a group of rambunctious students who are unable to be with their families for the year-end holidays has a premise with considerable potential that, unfortunately, is squandered by a narrative that feels loosely stitched together and ultimately comes across as patently undercooked. Indeed, what could have been a fun-filled romp a la a Christmastime take on movies like “Dead Poets Society” (1989), regrettably, comes up decidedly short. Admittedly, the film has its share of modestly funny and warm, fuzzy moments, but many of the scenes don’t flow smoothly from one to the next, creating a storyline that feels forced without delivering the goods to make a release like this work. While it’s true that the film succeeds (surprisingly) at depicting the mostly one-dimensional characters’ requisite personal evolution over the course of the picture, that almost-accidental accomplishment is seriously overshadowed by a series of plot elements that largely feel thrown together, incorporated without a terribly great amount of thought and an undeniable lack of cohesiveness. And, to be honest, the picture’s most interesting character is the academy’s chief cook (Da’Vine Joy Randolph), whose richly layered persona (and deftly nuanced performance) runs circles around those of its other two principals (Giamatti and Dominic Sessa as one of the stranded students). It’s disappointing that a director as talented as Alexander Payne has churned out a project as half-baked as this one is (particularly one that comes across as self-satisfied with itself as this offering often does) when compared to previous titles like “Nebraska” (2013) and “The Descendants” (2011). And would-be viewers should be wary of many of the inflated claims and awards season buzz being showered on this offering. But, in an age in which moviegoers are looking for pictures that provide the kind of holiday cinema comfort they so desperately crave, it’s understandable that such viewers might be drawn to a film like this. It’s just such a shame that they won’t find what they’re looking for in this one.'), ('9', 'Loved movie and the relationships that unfold. Was not expecting a Christmas movie but it was.

The movie is very touching and sad to the point where it made me cry.

This is not an uplifting movie. Be prepared to come out a bit depressed.'), ('9', ""Truly a wonderful film from Payne, with his deeply developed characters who have wit, heart, and substance, inside out.

Not a feel good holiday movie, so beware before you go.'), ('8', 'The cast is really impressive here obviously, would be nice for Giamatti to get some award recognitions this cycle.

I was expecting something a little closer to ""Class"", but this is far more earnest than that. An excellent period piece.'), ('6', 'I\'ll diverge from others and say this is a pretty depressing film. Other than this story flaw the acting, cinematography, and overall movie is quite good. Each scene seemed to present itself as depressing rather than as normal or hopeful. So, our view is: ""go ahead and watch the movie but do something to keep from being depressed.""'), ('8', ""In this latest offering from director Alexander Payne ('Election', 'Sideways', 'The Descendants', etc.), set in the 70s, a grumpy and contentious college history professor (Paul Giamatti) finds himself stuck on campus watching over the handful of young men unable to return home for the holidays for various reasons, and finds himself unexpectedly bonding and sympathizing with a particularly troubled young student (Dominic Sessa in an incredible debut). First of all, I didn't have too high of expectations going into this one, because truth be told, I've never really been all that big on Alexander Payne films. They've typically never been my cup of tea, as I find them a little too straightforward, pedestrian, or simply not funny or memorable enough. Most people seem to love his sophomore film 'Election', which I always found incredibly overrated and populated with nothing but unlikable characters. 'The Descendants' was cute and at times emotional, but also mostly forgettable in my eyes. And 'Nebraska' was simply boring and too understated. The only film of his I've ever truly loved is 'Sideways', which was full of wit, humor, and heart. Coincidentally enough, this was the only other time him and Giamatti worked together, that is until this film of course. And after watching this one, I've come to the conclusion that both of these men collaborating together creates pure onscreen magic, because I absolutely adored just about every minute of this funny, heartwarming, and charming little film. And yes, this is largely in part thanks to Giamatti and his brash yet yet compelling and humorous performance, but his chemistry and onscreen charisma and presence, particularly with newcomer Dominic Sessa is also the film's biggest highlight by far. However , Davine Joy Randolph also gives a superb supporting turn here as well. In addition, the screenplay and dialogue is witty and heartwarming in all the right places. Overall, this is a surprising yet very welcome return to form for Payne, and a long overdue reunion between him and Giamatti. I also now consider it the only other truly great film from Payne besides 'Sideways', which to me says a lot. I'm certain it'll charm and delight the pants off of most folks like it did me.""), ('6', ""Kinda mediocre in all regards. It's a bit funny, a bit sad, mildly interesting. Doesn't do anything that hasn't been done many times before and much better. Paul Giamatti is great as ever. The other performances are mixed. The young guy in the co-lead role isn't convincing as a student. I was left feeling like I'd wasted my time with this. But it's inoffensive and passes the time well enough.""), ('7', ""Paul Giamatti plays a grumpy teacher at a private New England prep school who's assigned to stay over the Christmas break with the students stuck there. Ultimately, he ends up with one particularly smart but troubled lad (newcomer Dominic Sessa, who's actually 22). They butt heads continuously with the only refuge for understanding from the school's head cook (Da'Vine Joy Randolph). As expected, the softening of their strife ends up with quiet connections and underplayed emotions. Since this was directed by Andrew Payne, there's a dry humorous approach that helps make the dramatic elements more palatable. Giamatti creates a curmudgeon with underlying sadness that serves as the film's core. The other performances are genuine and heartfelt. While the outcome is predictable, getting there is a sweet and salty character drama.""), ('8', 'I’m a big Alexander Payne guy, and this is just so cozy and funny and real like he (typically) is.'), ('9', 'Just a great little movie.

THINGS I LIKED: I had never seen Syd Sweeney before but I’m now a fan. We’ll all see her in the next Marvel movie, so she’s sure to become a household name. She does a fantastic job showing subtle emotions on her face, slowly revealing layers of truth and guilt as the movie digs deeper. Casting did a great job because Syd looks quite a bit like the real Reality Winner. The trio of cast members also includes Josh Hamilton and Marchant Davis. It’s an interesting storytelling device to show the actual transcripts from which the dialogue was taken and to introduce the characters. This was originally a stage play, but it feels like an original movie. Well done! Reality Winner is a real person. We even get to see pictures of the real Reality that were taken on the scene, as well as find out what happened to her after the events seen in the movie. We get to see how the FBI handles warrants. They seemed overly demanding and at times unreasonable. Did you think that too? I was surprised Reality never asked for an attorney. Instead, she answered all of their questions when they first appeared at her door. They never informed her of her rights. This is the kind of movie that will make you mad for a variety of reasons. I like movies that make you FEEL something, but especially THINK. She looked so young! In fact, Reality was 26 when arrested. And yeah, Reality is her real name. THINGS I DIDN’T LIKE: There are moments when the screen distorts, which can be annoying. It’s an effect to visually and audibly conceal locations, names, etc. There have been other movies called “Reality.” What name would you have given this film instead? Comment below! Some viewers might want more information about the facts of the events after they watch the movie. If you’re looking for action, you’ll be disappointed. The entire movie is just people standing around at Reality’s house, talking. I wonder how the people in real life thought about how they were portrayed in this movie.

She came home from the grocery store one day to find FBI agents waiting to search her house and interview her about leaked documents detailing Russia\'s interference in our elections. This re-creation of the encounter is played out verbatim from the FBI recordings. It\'s a fascinating experience, watching how the agents converse to gain her trust and uncover the truth. Writer/director Tina Satter adapted her play to the screen adding some additional moments of graphics and other visuals. Basically, this has 2 people interviewing one person in a minimal setting, but the tension holds steady without ever going big.

And by that, I mean she finally got a role that doesn't exploit that. Reality is quite competent, although its structure, being based on a play, compresses it a bit. A minor issue, but it's there. Now, the biggest problem is one that is fairly basic but completely elementary to its operation, and that is that unless you are American and, in this case, up on the news, you will be aware of who Reality Winner is and what she did, because otherwise the film makes no effort to explain what is going on and more importantly, the ramifications and consequences that come with it.

At the very beginning of the film, we see Ralph Fiennes acting as Roald Dahl, setting up his writing desk. Ralph had listened to tapes of Roald Dahl doing the same thing, so all that we see in the first minute is Ralph Fiennes basically channeling the famous author and improvising! Ralph Fiennes and Ben Kingsley were both in the Academy Award-winning movie Schindler’s List in 1993. Surprisingly, Ben Kingsley is the only Oscar winner in the film; however, three of the other actors were nominated: Benedict Cumberbatch, Dev Patel, and Ralph Fiennes. They all deserve that famous, gold trophy and, I’m certain they’ll each get one someday. Not a split second is wasted with quick dialogue that is delivered PERFECTLY by the actors. The set designs and color palette are perfect for a short, magical story like this. The humor is subtle, whimsical, and most welcome. Many of the humorous moments are the visual gags when the actors break the fourth wall and take turns as the narrator, talking straight to the audience wherever they find the camera. I haven’t read the source material, so I can’t tell you how closely it aligns with it; however, the film makes me want to, and that has to count for something, right? THINGS I DIDN’T LIKE: I wanted MORE! I wish that had been a feature film, but I understand that the story was short. Some viewers have complained that the lines are delivered too fast. That is absolutely true. It’s a style choice that I actually get a kick out of. If you don’t like Wes Anderson’s unique style, then you should definitely take a pass on this.

Narrative structure not fleshed out, and no exposition given to watcher. It is completely unaccessible as a singular film without pre-existing knowledge of Ghibli films or Miyazaki himself. If this would be your first Ghibli/Miyazaki film it’s a horrible watch. Good if you do have the required knowledge, but homework should not be required to have complete understanding of the film. The message should be clearly presented in the time, and should push the viewer to want to do some research on their own time to encourage a rewatch at a later time if pulled off correctly. This does not accomplish that.'), ('1', 'It’s a surrealist film about the visuals and experience like eraser head rather than being a real movie.'), ('6', ""As someone that has been a fan of Studio Ghibli since the early nineties, it's difficult for me to say that this the first of the studio's output in which I found nothing personally resonant or redeeming of the clear effort that was put into it visually. It's a meandering, aimless story, more nonsensical than charmingly surreal. In the brief moments that the film deigns to have an overt plot, it postures as a rumination on grief and the acceptance of inevitable finality. The performances suffered at turns from the worst deficits of nuance or warmth and the grossest excesses of shonenesque overacting, no relationships were meaningful, no characters had arcs that felt earned or organic. Every action and world happened in service of getting to an ending so abrupt and bereft of weight that one would be forgiven assuming that it was an intermission in the seconds between the fade out and the amateurish white Comic Sans credits against an insipid blue background. That design, whether conscious or not, is a reasonable approximation of the film as a whole: painfully color backgrounds existing only to demarcate the borders of narrow, infrequent negative space; specifically narrative, emotion, and growth rather than just letters. Aesthetically and kinetically there are things to enjoy, even celebrate on the rare occasion, but on the whole, if it be the last of his work, it's a swan song unbefitting of its author, an seeming expression of disenchantment with the very ideas of thematic meaning and growth from someone in the uttermost sunset of their days.

My biggest critique of this film is all show and no tell. you will not know what is going on throughout this whole movie and you have to accept that. In the past Ghibli followed your typical young, coming of age, protagonist, as they are forced to make life changing decisions at great cost. This story kinda harkens back to wherever the protagonist goes, the plot goes, most of the time it doesn't make much sense and it really bothers me that characters interact by talking at each other rather than communicating. This is high concept stuff and your kids might be bored by this adventure and as someone who gives more love for original animated films, this will not have the same legs that other films Miyazaki has made.""), ('10', 'epic film!

The Boy and the Heron feels more like a self indulgent love letter to his filmography, and does not function well alone as a stand alone movie to the casual viewer. The film is autobiographical in nature and without previous knowledge of Miyazaki’s personal life or his previous works you will struggle to follow along. This is attempted to be masked and keep you engaged by the fantastical nature of the worlds you visit and quality of the animation of the film in general, but is not quite pulled off effectively. The films audience is much too niche. It was written for Miyazaki, and fans of Miyazaki himself, moreso than film fans in general, or meant to entertain or convey an important message. It just does not land as a stand alone movie to be enjoyed on its own merits.'), ('10', 'Miyazaki\'s most complex film is also the most personal and symbolic one. The complexity of the plot of this work has left many people with doubts, Hayao Miyazaki himself leaves a message written on the great golden gate of the magical world: ""Whoever only seeks to understand, will perish."" Thus warning the viewer who wants all the answers in a first viewing, that it is not necessary to understand everything to enjoy the trip. Before watching the movie, you should know that it is his most abstract and metaphorical work... And that, of course, may be liked more or less, depending on the type of spectator you are, but there is nothing negative about it. Especially since we are talking about a case in which this abstraction is very well executed and in the most personal way. We are not talking about it being an especially surreal film in the style of David Lynch\'s cinema, since the most basic aspects of its plot can be understood and continued without problems from its first viewing. But the complexity is everything behind it, the similarities with the author\'s life, the great final metaphor with Miyazaki\'s current situation and the Studio Ghibli itself and all the symbols that the work hides in a masterfully way. In a time where all the great animated productions look for generic scripts, leaving no loose doubt at the end and everything closed (that\'s actually not something negative but in fact more commercial, since in the end those are works that with a single viewing you can forget, because there is not much else to excavate)... Miyazaki has clearly sought to create conversation, with a work that can be understood on the surface after only a viewing but that inevitably seeks to give something to talk about after finishing it, and even see it again. But although there are doubts as in every good Ghibli film, this work has hidden answers, many of them are deciphered with some context about the author\'s life or knowledge about the moments he symbolizes, but for others it is enough with a second viewing to fill every gap. Its symbols and references to cultural works as important as Dante Alighieri\'s ""Divine Comedy"" or its great similes with the director\'s childhood and life, reflect that in this film Miyazaki has wanted us to notice his author\'s stamp more than ever, therefore, he is much more personal than any of his previous ones. Even though, we will talk about a plot that, although complex, is simple in the superficial, and at the same time, surprisingly one of the most cohesive of the director once you understand the nuances. The film has a great execution of its rhythm, which begins as a slow walk, more realistic and mature, cooking the plot on low heat while showing us mistakes, gestures or simple scenes of how a character changes clothes that any conventional film would have suppressed, but that Miyazaki (as he really does in all his previous films), decides to show those to us for giving animated realism to his characters, who also err in their daily actions. But little by little in that realism a fantasy is dripping that threatens the viewer, and is getting closer and closer, and when it arrives, it floods the screen. And that\'s when the rhythm leaves that realism a little more aside to immerse ourselves in an agile rhythm adventure that takes us through endless places that overflow imagination. And we could also talk about his curious characters, many quite memorable and who will undoubtedly go down in history as some of the most charismatic of the studio\'s films, such as the heron itself or the parakeets. And others that follow the writing style of the director\'s characters: such as the Parakeet King, a subtle villain who ends up crumbling or Kiriko, the already classic representation of a strong and capable woman from Miyazaki\'s cinema. Without going into spoilers, little more can I say, beyond the fact that visually the film is a technical portent that will artistically dazzle anyone. The quality of its animations is masterful and the film is a great poem that reminds us that traditional animation, or simply 2D, still has a lot to offer, and that 3D CGI does not replace it, nor is it the future, since it is just one more technique.'), ('8', ""Another beautiful piece of art by Hiyao Miyazaki, though not perfect and certainly not the best movie he's done, it is deffinitely a worthy addition to his filmography.

I would recoment it everyone'), ('9', 'IN A NUTSHELL: If you weren’t able to buy tickets and travel to one of the cities that hosted Taylor Swift’s famous”The Eras Tour”, you can now get front-row seats in an AMC theater near you! Rather than working with major film studios, Taylor Swift chose to distribute this movie directly through AMC. The movie version of her tour was directed by Sam Wrench. You’ll be able to see more than if went to the concert. The film has already been nominated for the Best Music Documentary by the Critics Choice Documentary Award! When Taylor pitched the idea to the major film distributors, they all said no. She knew her fans were loyal, so she released it through her own company at her own expense. The film has already grossed $131 million! Smart, talented, and beautiful. THINGS I LIKED: If you’re a “Swiftie”, you’ll love this movie. If you don’t really know her music, this is a great introduction to her and to her raving fans who have memorized every single word of each of her songs and exuberantly sing along with Taylor. Taylor Swift handed a hat to someone in the audience at the end of the 22. It turns out, the recipient was Kobe Bryant gave Taylor Swift an award for selling out the Staples Arena two times. Taylor and young Bianka hug twice, an instant heartwarming moment of the show. The movie CRUSHED all box office ticket sales during its opening weekend. She didn’t want the theater screenings to be sparsely attended on weekdays, so she only ran the film from Thursday to Sunday. The direction gives you the best seat in the house. You see Taylor up close, but you also get shots of singing fans and aerial views that are very cool. The director does a great job giving you intimate, close-up moments with Taylor but also pans out so you can see the enormous scope of the arena and sets. I loved the costume changes and set designs. Taylor Swift captivates the audience when she is alone on the stage just as much as when she has dancers, backup singers, and staging gimmicks. If the gorgeous and talented Margot Robbie didn’t exist, Taylor Swift would have been the perfect Barbie in her glittery bathing suit. One of the most stunning things about Taylor Swift is that she is still extremely loved and has decades more to come where she’ll be writing and singing even more great hits! The movie features Taylor Swift’s diverse team of backup singers and dancers. THINGS I DIDN’T LIKE: If you think you’re going to be able to sit in your theater seat and enjoy the show, you’re mistaken. Fans are going to stand up, dance, and sing all around you. That might be fun or annoying, depending on who else is in the audience with you! If you’re expecting behind-the-scenes interviews, you’ll be disappointed. The film is just the concert. At a length of just under 3 hours, watching this movie is a serious investment of time. The good news is that it’s 3 hours of fun. There is something really special that happens at Taylor Swift’s concerts that the movie didn’t really capture well: friendship bracelets. Attendees of Taylor Swift’s shows always bring friendship bracelets to exchange with one another. We got to see a few clips of girls wearing them during the final rolling credits, but it would have been cute to see girls actually swapping them with each other during the concert to show that’s a very real part of the whole experience and something the concert goers truly look forward to.

D&D are so rich of content!!! This movie delivered what was promisse, a adventure, its okay!'), ('6', 'I did NOT want to see this movie. I was steadfast against it because of the writers saying the quiet part out loud about purposely emasculating men. Spoiler alert: they weren\'t kidding (except for a nicely portrayed old school Paladin). But, being a parent of a teen, he was quite keen to see this movie, and we have strongly bonded over both baseball and old school AD&D, so off to the theater we went (matinee prices). I played AD&D in the 80s, during the height of the ""zomg satanic"" scares. My friends and I were, above all, nerds. Stranger Things portrayed that aspect of us quite well, minus the parallel world and telekinetic teen. It\'s been a joy to play AD&D as DM for my children and friends, although we are strictly a 1e, not 5e world. I\'m sort of pleased to see so many people trying to retrofit to 1e from 5e in light of latest drama. However, having said that, I still recognized that this movie was going to try to cater/nod its way towards 5e players. The inclusion of things like the Dragonborn and bird people(?) races confirmed that for me. To the critiques: Even APART from ""most tabletop adventures at home will be better than what the writers can come up with"" criticism (which I find quite valid), we shouldn\'t forget that Gary Gygax et al created just EPIC adventures in module form. Tomb of Horrors, the Against the Giants series, even The Temple of Elemental Evil are all rousing adventures that are just sort of . . . out there for inspiration. My son pointed out that adventures like that almost might be better for a streaming service, in a serial form. That would also allow for far more character development/arcs. More nitpicky: I guess that while I enjoyed the movie, I also had quite a few problems with the writers not taking a few simple extra steps for either fan service, or just . . . making the movie MORE like D&D. For instance, Capt. Kirk certainly is portrayed to be a Bard. The old Bard started off as a fighter, abandons that class to become a thief, and then after sufficient time becomes a Bard, whereupon the character can employ abilities from the two abandoned classes. Capt. Kirk is shown, early in the movie, to be a fighter (armored, with a sword), later gives that up to become a thief, and then wields a lute, but there\'s no mention as to why that\'s important. IS he even a Bard, or do they just go to efforts to make it look that way, and then ""lol nope?"" Even a throwaway line might have helped, much less him using his OWN lute to cast an illusion at a later point in the movie (I won\'t be specific since it\'s just out). Also, what was with the ""wheel of spells"" thing on the belt of the Magic User? Not a line about how he got it, what it even is, or why he is inept at selecting spells? Is it a random thing, like the Deck of Many Things, or a Wand of Wonder? There is a single mention of the word ""Cleric"" in the movie -- those are typically healers. With a bit more knowledge, the writers could have allowed the Magic User to say, at a CERTAIN point in the movie (""I can\'t help [person]. I\'m not a cleric.""). Something like that, at least. Finally, they went to a hell of a lot of trouble to obtain the helm -- did anyone see what became of it by the end of the movie? Is this a Shazam 2 thing, where in the next movie someone is going to find it in a museum? Despite all these criticisms overall the movie was certainly . . . mid. Worth the matinee price at least. I\'ll be interested in how much 5e players like this movie compared to my traditionalist 1e self.'), ('10', 'A great movie for fans or not fans of the role playing genre!!!

It was even better than I hoped for. The story starts with the bard Edgin and female barbarian Holga in a prison. They hope to be pardoned and telling the story how they got into trouble. However this is just the set up as they did not know that there was more behind it. The story fully works. All characters have their flaws, motivations and heroes journey. More movies need to do this. I liked them because I can relate to their struggles. Everyone has doubts, made decisions that backfire or dis-improves things by trying to fix them. There are also tons of lore, easter eggs and references. If you pay attention you even see the characters from the old D&D cartoon. The cast is near perfect and fits their roles. Chris Pine, Michelle Rodrigues, Sophia Lillis, Rege Jean Page, Justine Smith and all the others are excellent and have great chemistry. The bad guys are so enjoyable. I love to hate them. I should also praise the writers and directors. They made an awesome movie. Other than that I praise the humor and action scenes. Both are fully satisfying. The special effects are great too. They fit into the movie in a way that feels genuine. Overall I think I should give a 10/10. It might not be that good but it is a positive surprise and immense improvement.

It pains me to even acknowledge that this is the last film in this series. Say it isn’t so, James Gunn! He wrote and directed the film. At the beginning of the film, we see the lights turn off in Quill’s bedroom, illustrating that James Gunn is putting this trilogy to bed. But surely, Marvel won’t really retire this hugely successful part of the MCU, right??? Here’s how the studio describes this final installment: In Marvel Studios “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3” our beloved band of misfits are looking a bit different these days. Peter Quill, still reeling from the loss of Gamora, must rally his team around him to defend the universe along with protecting one of their own. A mission that, if not completed successfully, could quite possibly lead to the end of the Guardians as we know them. THINGS I LIKED: The fantastic cast includes our fan favorites: Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, Karen Gillan, Pom Kementieff, Vin Diesel, Bradley Cooper, Sean Gunn, Chukwudi Iwuji, Will Poulter, Sylvester Stallone, Elizabeth Debicki, and more! The beginning of the movie starts on a sad, serious note, something I wasn’t expecting. Lots of creative set pieces. Gunn does a great job blending tense action scenes with humor and heart. We get to find out Rocket Raccoon’s origin story. Awwww… It is said that many of the songs in the film are diegetic, which means the characters can hear the music. The song that opens and closes the trilogy is “Come and Get Your Love” by Redbone. Sweet. Keep watching during the rolling credits at the end of the movie for another cute scene that references Kevin Bacon. As always, the soundtrack is terrific. The rest of the music by John Murphy was excellent. The story is extremely emotional. You WILL cry. We get a few short cameo performances from a few past characters. Yay! No spoilers! I always love the slow-motion action sequences. So entertaining. THINGS I DIDN’T LIKE: The movie definitely assumes that you already know and love the characters, and understand how the Guardians’ universe works. If you haven’t seen any of the Guardians movies, you should absolutely not start with this one. Start from the beginning. Too many of the costumes and sets look like costumes and sets: more design than magic. In fact, this movie sets a new record for the most prosthetics (23,000) used on over 1000 actors. I wish the voice of Cosmo, the Spacedog, were different. It sounds too much like Mantis’ character. The female voice by Maria Bakalova was used to pay tribute to Laika, the Russian dog who was one of the first animals in space. There are way too many characters to keep track of in this final installment. So much yelling. The movie is messy with tonal changes. There are a lot of flashbacks that might confuse the timeline for some viewers. Ultimately, I wanted more. Because I’m such a fan of the franchise, I really wanted to be blown away but wasn’t.

Baird, and written by Noah Pink. Most people don’t know the history of Tetris, nor did they ever think they needed to. As it turns out, we did! Who knew it involved dangerous and deceitful people all over the world? THINGS I LIKED: Great performances all around. The talented cast features Taron Egerton. He’s such a chameleon of an actor. I adore him in everything he does. I was so happy for him when he won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Motion Picture for his role in Rocketman. For that same movie, he also won “Actor of the Year” from GQ Awards and Satellite Awards, the “Virtuoso Award” by the Santa Barbara International Film Festival, “Breathrough Actor Award” by Hollywood Film Awards, and many more. One of these days, he’s going to win an Oscar. I think he’s that great! His infectious, charming personality in this role makes you root for him from beginning to end. Other cast members include Nikita Efremov, Toby Jones, Sofya Lebedeva, Ben Miles, Roger Allam, Rick Yune, Anthony Boyle, and more. I’ve never seen Toby Jones speak with that accent before! I always enjoy his performances. I love how elements of the actual Tetris game are embedded into the telling of the story, especially during transitions. Filming began in Scotland in 2020 but had to be put on hold due to the quarantine. Younger audiences will get to learn a little bit of what it was like to live during the Cold War. A better, more serious spy movie about that is Tom Hanks’ Bridge of Spies. Tetris is definitely not trying to be that movie, by the way. In an early scene, Henk talks about how he can still see the Tetris pieces in his dreams. This is actually a real phenomenon called the Tetris Effect. The term was coined by journalist Jeffrey Goldsmith in 1994 to describe when something that one focuses on for extended periods of time starts appearing in their thoughts, perceptions, and dreams. We get to learn about events at the end of the movie by seeing photos and text on the screen about the real people involved in the events of the story. Lorne Balfe created original music that sounds like it could be in a Tetris game itself. It’s fascinating to watch how video games moved the world’s technology to the average person. We see the same thing happening today with virtual reality. I recently started exercising to some really fun games on my son’s VR headset. VR is AMAZING. The technology is so astounding and real that I accidentally crashed into a wall in my house and hurt my arm. ha ha THINGS I DIDN’T LIKE: Some audiences will be bored watching all of the legal licensing negotiations, which is the bulk of the movie. Robert Maxwell’s makeup looked super plastic and odd. When the real Henk Rogers and Alexey Pazhitnov reviewed the script, they revealed that a lot of the facts aren’t quite true, being given a Hollywood flourish to the story details. TIPS FOR PARENTS: Kids will be completely bored because every scene is mostly adults arguing in legalese. Some profanity, including F-bombs. There are subtitles that need to be read when Japanese and Russian are spoken.'), ('8', 'Tetris succeeds with its upbeat energy even when the first half of the film becomes bogged down and slightly uneventful, the performance by Taron Edgerton keeps the audience engaged along with a fun electronic score.

The movie was directed by Ben Affleck with some writing help by Matt Damon and Alex Convery. THINGS I LIKED: The inspirational movie was directed by Ben Affleck, who also stars in it. What a career he has had so far and he just barely turned 50! He’s a really good actor, director, and storyteller. Congrats and kudos to him! Michael Jordan wasn’t directly involved with the movie; however, Ben Affleck consulted with him several times to ensure the story was told accurately. Michael Jordan had two special requests: that Viola Davis play his mother and that Howard White be included in the movie. I love it that Ben Affleck included his long-time buddy, Matt Damon, in the movie. They both also serve as producers of the movie. Matt Damon actually wore a fat suit for this role as Sonny Vaccaro, mostly to give him a big belly. Both Ben Affleck and Matt Damon spent quite a bit of time rewriting the original screenplay, but due to some technical rules by the WGA, they weren’t given writing credits on the film. Boo! This is their 20th movie collaboration together! Viola Davis and Julius Tennon, who are actually married in real life, play Michael Jordan’s parents. The fantastic cast includes 3 Academy Award winners: Viola Davis, Matt Damon, and Ben Affleck! It also includes Jason Bateman, Chris Messina, Gustaf Skarsgard, Marlon Wayans, and Chris Tucker. Everyone did an excellent job in their roles. The movie credits open with a quick download of all of the trending things that were happening in the 1980s, long before the word “trending” was a thing, by the way. Michael Jordan wore two different numbers on his jerseys during his career: 45 & 23, so this movie, Air, was released on 4/5/23. Sweet! The fun soundtrack really took me back to the 80s. Ben Affleck wanted to use even more epic songs of the day but buying rights would have put him over budget. Everything is about branding these days. This movie illustrates how a successful company took it to another whole level! I’m always fascinated to learn how legends are made and what contributed to a successful company or marketing campaign. Lots of fun banter between characters. It’s the dialogue that drives the story. We get to see photos and images of all the real people involved in the true story at the end of the movie. We also get to see some of Michael Jordan’s magical moments on the court. THINGS I DIDN’T LIKE: It’s kind of odd that Michel Jordan or the character who plays him isn’t even in the script! We only see Michael Jordan from behind in the movie. Honestly, it felt like a giant infomercial to buy Air Jordan shoes.

There's a scene where Damon's character makes a speech for Michael Jordan to convince him to sign the deal. It's meant to evoke emotion instead it just falls flat and is manipulative.

I am happy to see we can have a boxing movie without Rocky (Let the dude retire, he deserves it by now!). There is really good character development around the main cast, though most of the side characters tended to blend together; no Michael Peña from Ant-Man here, but that is fine, it should be about Creed and his family, after all. They did pretty good with Drago and left me wanting a spin-off and seeing him become champion! I wouldn't be against a Rocky Cinematic Universe. I also really enjoyed the music quite a bit, even though I don’t really listen to rap. All the orchestral and rap music fit the scenes and vibe of the film. And the boxing scenes may be some of the best looking yet. Like in every Rocky and Creed film, they try new cinematography ideas for the boxing scenes; they were pretty interesting. There were a few scenes I thought were a bit off, but nothing egregious. I did like the antagonist (though I wish they did a better job explaining his specific crime and length of time in prison) as it is one that feels multidimensional and has motivations that are understandable. If you are a fan of the Creed films, this is the third good one in a row and suggest it to any fans of the series. The movie is not perfect as the writing can be rough around the edges, but I enjoyed most of the film and it left me wanting more.""), ('8', 'Very good boxing movie. The fights in this third installment are spectacular!'), ('7', ""I think Creed III was very entertaining but not as good as the last two. The stakes don't feel as high in this one and I thought that the dramatic punch that the finale of both the first and second had was missing here. I think the pacing is very good and there is never a scene that drags. I feel like this movie would have benefitted from being a bit longer and develop why Donnie fighting Damian was actually worth it. Jonathan Majors is electric in this film and the film blows by really quickly.""), ('5', 'Not a bad movie and not a good one. Middle of the road all the way around.

Would have loved to watch this as a television series.'), ('1', 'This movie is nothing like the originals that this movie tries to take advantage of. Where is Rocky?'), ('8', 'IN A NUTSHELL: He’s back! Adonis has been thriving in both his career and family life, but when a childhood friend and former boxing prodigy resurfaces, the face-off is more than just a fight. Congratulations to Michael B. Jordan for directing this movie, as well as starring in it! He was the Executive Producer of the 2018 Creed II, and now he’s ready for the big show. He loves anime, so you actually see some influences from Dragon Ball Z and Naruto in the film. The writing team consists of Keenan Coogler, Zach Baylin, and Ryan Coogler. THINGS I LIKED: The terrific cat includes Michael B. Jordan, Tessa Thompson, Jonathan Majors, Wood Harris, Phylicia Rashad, and Thaddeus J. Mixson as the young Adonis Creed. I’ve never seen a bad performance by Michael B. Jordan. As expected, he’s great in this movie. Jonathan Majors looks amazing and does a fantastic job. You should also check out his recent performance in Devotion. Little Mila Davis-Kent is totally adorable as Creed’s daughter. She’s deaf in real life. Amazing slow-motion boxing shots. Wow. For all of you fellow nerds out there, you’ll be interested to know that this 3rd movie in the Creed series is being released on the 3rd day of the 3rd month in the 3rd year of the 3rd decade of the third millennium of the Common Era. It’s fun to hang out in Adonis Creed’s gorgeous house. I love that the movie features some of the pageantry in boxing when both boxers parade into the arena with their music and entourage before the big fight. That’s always my favorite part of boxing matches. One of my sons was a boxer for a short time. My husband thinks boxing is the coolest sport ever. I love training montages, except I felt like such a slug watching it while sitting on my butt and eating while watching. I definitely need to work out harder. Ha ha Hard-hitting soundtrack! I’m always amazed at how they film boxing scenes to make them look so real. I thought the scenes that just showed the two of them, alone, in a ring were especially effective and offered the perspective of how personal the fight was for the two men. Many of the famous boxing announcers and TV personalities offer cameo performances. I always get a kick out of that because it lends credibility to the scenes as if they’re in real-life. THINGS I DIDN’T LIKE: Sylvester Stallone does not appear in this sequel, which is a shame. He crafted the Rocky character and franchise, but was, sadly, left out of this new addition. That seems super disrespectful to ole Sly, as well as a disappointment to many fans. He hasn’t hidden his frustration about being shut down by Ryan Coogler and Irwin Winkler, saying he’ll never watch this movie. What’s really missing in this sequel is the heart and soul that Rocky always gave us. I assume we’re going to see Bianca competing in the ring one of these days, eh? Act 3 feels very rushed compared to the first two acts. For example, we see Dane call out Adonis in a show, and then, suddenly, they’re training and in the ring. There’s no conversation between Adonis and his wife who, surely, would have a strong opinion about his fighting again after so many physical dangers to his battered body. We see her hugging him as he enters the ring, clearly supporting him in his decision to fight again. It just felt like a huge jump in time and story. Like all of the movies in the Rocky and Creed universe, this film is extremely predictable. TIPS FOR PARENTS: Sign language and Spanish are spoken with subtitles. Lots of fighting action in and outside of the boxing ring. Talk of jail time. A girl gets in trouble at school for punching another student. Some of the music has explicit profanity and offensive language, including the “N” word. Some young teens get in a fight with a gun when cops arrive on the scene.'), ('6', ""Alright movie but it got away from what made this movie great. No Stallone in this one either. Now he's retiring already. Kind of dumb. I want to see him box more maybe more fights. It's always just one fight. Idk he's to young to retire and I don't want to watch him become a trainer now just like rocky.""), ('7', 'Possibly has the weakest boxing scenes of any of the Creed or even the Rocky movies. Michael B. Jordan tries to be too stylish with the slow motion and etc. The story and performances are at least good. It’s funny how Jonathan Majors pays the older one of the two former friends. When Michael B. Jordan is 36 and Majors is 33. I was into the main fight until it pretty much turned into a silly dream sequence. That was more about the cgi than the fight. By the time it got back to reality, I barely cared anymore about the fight. There was too much style. That takes you out of the fight. With the last fight weaker than maybe any from a Rocky or Creed movie. The movie is more about the friendship and their history than the fight but still the fight was weak.'), ('7', ""This was yet another excellent chapter in the Rocky/Creed series, however it's also one of the most aesthetically unique. As this is Michael B. Jordan's first film as a director, I think he is still figuring things out and doesn't quite get the look he was trying for. Also, the movie suffers a little bit to transition between acts; it always feels a little abrupt. Having said that, the rest of the film is effective. The main plus is the antagonist; Jonathan Majors portrays one of the rocky/creed series' most nuanced and engaging antagonists. Outside of him, the battle sequences are superb, the character development is outstanding, and the training montages are strong. Where Michael B. Jordan's style really shines are the combat sequences.""), ('6', 'ok thats it for the creed franchise - its done well so leave it at that yeah'), ('7', ""I love the Rocky franchise. It has its lows and its over-the-top entries but for the most part, this series has been mostly hits than misses. Creed was a spinoff and I never expected to enjoy it so immensely. I loved Creed 1 and Creed 2 which is why I was hoping for a hat trick with Creed 3. There was some worry as this is the first entry without Rocky. it was also Michael B. Jordan's directorial debut with him starring as Creed and directing. So does it succeed or is this a miss? Firstly, Michael did a great job in his directorial debut. He pushes the Creed movies out of Rocky's shadow and gives it more grit. The fights feel more visceral and flashy with some clear anime-inspired influence. He uses a lot of slow-mo which leads to some nice-looking shots. I also think the boxing intro and montage were also really well shot as well. He also does something interesting in the final fight that involves silence which gave it a new feel. The soundtrack was awesome and the cinematography is great. He also gives darker qualities to the story with the backstory and personal connection with the antagonist Damian (Jonathan Majors). On that note, Jonathan Majors is terrific as the antagonist. I love his performance, with the subtle awkwardness and slightly pained expression in the first half. Then in the second half, we get to see Jonathan give an arrogant, menacing performance when he goes full bad guy. I also enjoyed how sympathetic he is as a character as well. You understand why Adonis would help him. Additionally, Michael continues to give a great performance as Adonis Creed with the amount of emotional moments in this film. There is great chemistry between Michael and Jonathan which made the friendship between their characters feel believable. Tessa returns as Bianca and she is good in her small role in this film as well. However, I do have some issues with this film. The first half focuses on building up the characters and eventual conflict which is fine. The second half is incredibly rushed though with clearly many cuts made towards it. We don't get a great sense of how much time passed so it is baffling to suddenly see Damian successful so quickly. It would've helped to have seen Damian in more fights. We could have seen him growing more and more successful while also seeing how much of a threat he is. Unfortunately, this movie doesn't have a lot of boxing fights and enough build-up in the second half. It is also weird how quickly Damian's personality changes. Another issue is the lack of inner conflict for Adonis. We see him feeling guilty about what happened to Damian but that's mostly it. For example, we don't see his doubt about retiring or concern about his daughter and wife. On that note, there is a daughter subplot introduced in this film that went nowhere. Felt very pointless. Overall, Creed III is another good entry in this franchise. It's an impressive directorial debut from Michael and I look forward to future work from him, Creed or otherwise. Even without Rocky, this franchise seems to be doing well standing on its own feet. I'm not sure what direction Creed 4 can go in but if it is of a similar quality to previous entries, then I will 100% be there to watch!""), ('8', ""The drama has some low moments, but visually it's the more interesting film in the saga""), ('0', ""Horrible!!! I hate this movie because isn't Rocky movie. I not recomended to watch it""), ('6', ""Inconsistant story saved by the musical atmosphere of a Rocky movie. Yes, it's still a Rocky spinoff.

However, the novelty of the series has run its course and believe it or not, not having Stallone involved actually hurt this installment.'), ('8', ""As a Rocky fan who didn't really love Creed II, I thought Creed III was the true sequel to the first Creed (which I hold in high regard and the best Rocky film besides the first). Similar narrative themes can be found from writer Ryan Coogler's other films like Creed, Black Panther, and Fruitvale Station but Creed III's unique identity definitely comes from new-director Michael B. Jordan, who infuses his own sensibilities and tastes into every scene. Especially the fight sequences. The film's core story felt similar to Rocky V but done in the right way; solid performances, great cinematography, well-paced editing, and clear directionality to the narrative. The film charts into more familiar and predictable territory near the half way marker where character, unfortunately, take a turn into cliche stereotypes and lose a bit of humanity. Emotional clarity is lost during training montages and what's at stake is a little muddled. Fortunately, it does end off on a high note with a satisfactory conclusion. I truly did feel like the absence of Sylvester Stalone's Rocky was not only missed, but could've been narratively powerful, sending the film soaring. His absence doesn't compromise the film altogether but would've been a good film truly great with the right scene.""), ('9', 'Honestly, a great movie. Michael B.

Yes. Original? Not really. The plot has enough intrigue, and its leading trio sustains the story properly, but there comes a point where the plot itself wants to emphasize the social theme so much that the rest gets lost, and instead of focusing on entertainment, the filmmaker seems more interested in delivering some sort of lecture. They Cloned Tyrone primarily feeds on the paranoia that abounds in conspiracy theories. Above all else, it highlights the central point that the government and corporations conspire to keep things from us, concealing a sinister and tantalizing truth we are not allowed to see. Ironically, people often believe they are too smart to fall for such deception, not realizing that they themselves are creating their own versions of the truth. But the undercurrent of paranoia is what fuels this movie. It starts with the familiarity of everyday life in the characters' existence and the reality they embody as stereotypical drug dealers. However, everything changes when the protagonist dies in one scene and then reappears alive in the next. That's where this movie really begins. The conspiracy that unfolds makes Get Out seem tame by comparison, yet the sinister and intriguing premise doesn't lead to more satisfying results because instead of flowing like the thriller it purports to be, almost the entire third act focuses more on explaining stuff rather than providing thrills. In essence, the film becomes excessively elaborate instead of intuitive and relaxed. It strives to overemphasize a concept rather than letting it unfold naturally. It's not that viewers don't understand the concept, but rather the plot insists on constantly reiterating it, as if assuming the audience can't grasp it on their own. This approach ultimately weakens the overall impact of the film. It's not the average junk with which Netflix usually fills its catalog, but it doesn't succeed in demonstrating anything outstanding either.""), ('4', 'Black paranoids will love it. The Truman Show meets Get Out. An ode to blacksploitation films of old. Good for a few laughs and almost genuine mystery in the first 1/2, but it’s ultimately a rinse and repeat of modern race politics.

When sci-fi begins to reaffirm the mainstream narratives to justify violence then it’s time to question whether it’s actually sci-fi and not just budget propaganda'), ('8', ""The best way to understand this movie? It is something like a love letter to blaxploitation cinema that made an era in the distant 70's, with all its excesses, and dysfunctional characters.

Together, the unlikely trio proceeds to investigate what’s going on, only to soon find themselves in the midst of a fiendish social experiment involving cloning, mind control and behavior modification targeting their entire neighborhood, a clandestine initiative operated by an evil organization headed by a bigoted mastermind (Kiefer Sutherland). As intriguing as that narrative may sound, however, the picture’s execution leaves much to be desired. For starters, the film is trying way too hard to imitate the works of writer-director Jordan Peele, with more than a few thinly veiled elements that echo “Get Out” (2017) and “Us” (2019). Then there are a number of serious technical issues, most notably the picture’s truly horrendous sound quality (generally throughout, but especially in the first 30 often-undecipherable minutes) and its needlessly dark cinematography (there’s a big difference between atmospheric and incomprehensible). To top that off, many of this release’s attempts at humor fall flat and/or lazily rely on shamelessly milking well-worn stereotypes, often verging on insulting. To its credit, “They Cloned Tyrone” does offer some valuable (if a bit overly obvious) pieces of social commentary, making the second half more watchable than the first. It also features a fine performance by Parris, who often steals scenes and leaves her co-stars in the dust.

This movie was tough to watch because I had no idea what was going to happen next. Michael Fassbender's portrait of a contract killer on the run made me really appreciate my dull, ordinary life. I know I wouldn't have the heart for The Killers line of work. Great movie.""), ('6', ""Slickly shot and smartly acted, The Killer is an enjoyable couple hours if you don't mind style over substance. Fassbender and Swinton turn in stunning performances but can't quite hold the delicate plot and characterisation long enough for it to say anything on par with how fantastically the film is shot. Sound design helps highlight the hard-hitting action but its slow pace feels at war with the rest of The Killer's parts. Overall, it's slickly shallow with more to show than to say.""), ('7', 'In his latest film, ""The killer"", David Fincher takes us into the twisted mind of a solitary nameless hitman, in a work that is essentially a stream of consciousness, completely filtered from the perspective of a killer devoted to the denial of errors, improvisations, and everything that makes us human beings, such as affections, emotions and empathy. Taken from a comic miniseries written by Matz and illustrated by Luc Jacamon and published from 1998 to 2014 - for many viewers this film may seem banal, monotonous and boring in its linear, schematic, cold and repetitive nature, in reality if you watch it with the right approach you will become passionate, as the tense crescendo is not in the events but in the invisible evolution of the character; an infallible professional killer, highly trained, rigid in following his precise rules of conduct, who loves attention to detail and total control, yet unaware of self-deception on many aspects of his personality and reality, but also on his way of (not) relating to society and the people around him. The careful mix of writing and staging, as effective and controlled as the methodical, cold protagonist, manages to involve and conceal a stimulating reflection on the human psyche and contemporary society, suspended between order and disorder. In fact, the plot is only a pretext to let us enter the psyche of the killer (a convincing and credible Fassbender), who appears almost a re-visitation of the protagonists of Jean-Pierre Melville\'s detective/noir films, but with much less charm. The actor with his icy face manages to tell us all about the detachment but at the same time also the vulnerabilities of his character. Thriller (but also revenge movie) tense and with a geometric style, rich in style and visual refinement, both in staging and in form; ""The Killer"" is an elegant genre film which, thanks to its philosophical (the banality of Evil) and existential slant, is much more than it appears, and, although quite conventional, manages to be interesting and entertain with pleasure. In addition to the beautiful incipit, the director offers us at least two other memorable sequences: a fight in the dark in an apartment and a dialogue with the always good Tilda Swinton. The aforementioned direction is worthy of note, but also the photography and editing, as well as the soundtrack by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross (the alternation of silence with music, and of the monologue with the unsaid is admirable in this sense). In conclusion, ""The killer"" is one of the most successful and meaningful works in David Fincher\'s filmography, and it is recommended to watch it. Score (in tenths): 7.25'), ('0', 'What a boring and tedious to watch film. I fast forwarded through it and still almost fell asleep.'), ('5', 'This is what Netflix does to the movie world. Not much Fincher left, still not bad, but good is something else (as we in Austria say).'), ('3', ""Fincher, who is otherwise brilliant, seems to have rushed through this on a contract basis, similar to his cliched, dull protagonist. The film is a disappointingly mediocre episodic sequence or events with zero payoff and nothing more to show for it other than a few stylish sequences far and between the mediocrity. Huge Fincher fan, so it's hard to believe he made this dud. And what waste of the wonderful Tilds Swinton.""), ('5', 'to quote my girfriend: “the best part about it was the ending because it meant it was over”.'), ('5', 'What’s the what, Streamers! Netflix has a robust slate of new releases at the end of this year, which includes the new movie directed by David Fincher, The Killer. David Fincher has made some really amazing films that are meticulously controlled and brimming with suspense like Se7en, Zodiac, and The Girl with the Dragon Tatoo. After his foray into prestige, biopic territory with Mank, it is good to see Fincher return to this pure genre exercise. Here’s how it went.Based on a French graphic novel, The Killer follows the story of an assassin (Michael Fassbender) who makes a fateful mistake on a job that leads to an international race to clean up the mess the only way he knows how. The Killer spouts his philosophy on doing his job, but it all seems to unravel minute by minute. As things crumble in successive vignettes, The Killer has to maintain control as best he can. Bloody, bloody, heavily-narrated hijinks ensue.Well, to be generous, The Killer is deliberately paced. Okay, it is very slow. Fincher has made the choice to build tension by very slowly unfurling this story. There is so much narration by the main character that it becomes oppressive. It’s a good way to get us inside the mind of this unreadable, unknowable man, but it is exhausting and borders on boring. It takes a while for the action of this “Action” movie to kick in, but it might be too little, too late when it does. There is one epic fight sequence that would almost be worth the price of admission, but it comes very late in the film. Beyond that, the Killer uses some interesting and chuckle-worthy aliases on his various travels. Fincher has his typical, cool aesthetic that makes the movie look very slick. I think trimming this movie about 30 minutes would have made it a much more engrossing and vital suspense thriller.Side note: Tilda Swinton comes in for one scene and kills it as usual.Ultimately, The Killer is very slow and there’s not enough story to justify the runtime. This movie should have been cut down by 30 minutes. Fincher is a master of suspense and has a cool aesthetic, but overall, this film is too slow and boring except for one intense fight sequence.

If you watch it five times, as I have, you will discover subtle bunnies of logic and meaning on each viewing. It asks but does not answer: why would someone pay to have someone else killed?

Wes has his actors engage in WAY too much dialogue and excruciating exposition with little to no action or intrigue. He directs his actors to speak in monotone with little to no facial expressions - this guy is deliberately making a boring film! Many, many reviewers give Wes a pass but why?! If a film school student made this, they\'d be told to seek another career because they just don\'t get the FUNDAMENTALS of film making!

Absence of answers and absence of inspiration. ''Asteroid City'' reflects in an abstract, conceptual and lyrical way on the lack of meaning of living; on human beings who search for meanings and new awareness; the discovery of something authentic about ourselves and our place in the world, as well as the mysteries of existence. However, Anderson's aesthetic appears in this film to be folded in on itself, uninspired and not very functional on an expressive level. And in the end, emotional strength is also missing. A refined and accurate work, elegant and pleasant from a visual/formal point of view (the usual pastel colours, the frontal shots, the geometric lateral tracking shots, the moving sets, the infinite cast of stars, the anti-naturalistic staging), interesting underneath that of the narrative structure (an imaginary theater show, which is also a television show, which is also the film we are watching); but which unfortunately remains the victim of the overly calculated and somewhat dry weight of its approach. A unique and coherent cinema, that of Wes Anderson, always beautiful to look at and recognisable; but now we would like it to be a little less theoretical and ''repetitive'', and a little more aimed at that poetic novelty/authenticity originally possessed by the career, as well as at the human dimension that finds in the intensity of feelings the more engaging trait.

If so, to whom is it addressed when that cultural movement which dominated the 1st half of the twentieth century in the West is perceived as foreign by the current generation? In Nietzsche\'s distinction between active nihilism, undisputed adherence to the status quo, and passive nihilism, its resigned and desperate rejection, the (neo)existentialist approach seems to coincide with the second typology, powerless to translate the denunciation into some constructive proposal. The Coens, Tarantino, McDonagh, the films adapted from McCarthy\'s novels are more attracting and satisfying thanks to pulp brutalities exhibited and shown. Instead, this last work by Anderson is dereliction in its pure state, expressly desert-like, an undaunted emphasize on the void of meaning that afflicts the cosmos, including any eventual alien. ""I still don\'t understand the play."" ""Doesn\'t matter. Just keep telling the story."" The unmistakable style of the director is at the service of the addicted coexistence with a perennial Apocalypse, the narrative plot takes place among the mushrooms of nuclear tests, Cranston enters a shot, asks if he is in the right place and then withdraws, they talk to suicides of suicides with a frozen and chilling tone, in the absurd logic and feelings lose all value.

The delightfully artistic production design and appealingly pastel cinematograghy as usual from Wes Anderson's film. However, I must honestly say that this might be an beautifully odd and very different film I could ever expected from his post-2010 films. First thing that comes to my mind is that his dark-comedic style and plot-driven actually leave some flaws on the smoothness of emotional relationship for each main characters. But, I somehow find its nice touch from seeing Wes digs deeper into human's loneliness by never leaving its fast pacing and his uniquely dark-comedic style, flawlessly and masterfully. The satire for political events and human connections are also never missed a beat. The unusual narrative can sometimes confuse audiences on their first-half watching, but even so, at some point, once the film reveals its self-concept, I'm pretty sure the audiences will somehow try connecting those dots that film had left for us all along, and certainly find a beauty of the hidden message.""), ('10', ""A visually and artistically beautiful, slowly-unfolding metaphor about grief, existentialism, art and the human experience. Asteroid City is not an 'easy' movie, often requiring the viewer to pay attention to small details that return later in satisfying and emotionally compelling ways — something made easier by the film's hypnotizing cinematography. Wes Anderson creatively makes use of multiple frame narratives in a manner rarely seen in modern cinema to tell an enchantingly beautiful story once you get to the core of it. Admittedly, it can get a little hard to follow at times, but yields good returns if you surrender your attention to this piece of art.""), ('7', 'I connected with the sense of isolation and loneliness.

Well, that's how this movie struck me. Gratuitous kitsch.""), ('9', 'IN A NUTSHELL: If you’re a Wes Anderson fan, you’ll get a kick out of his newest addition. He has such a unique, quirky style that entire YouTube channels have been devoted to him by visual artists who create movie trailers in his style. You have to see them! They’re hilarious and awesome! This movie was directed and written by Wes Anderson, with additional writing help from Roman Coppola. The story is about a father who takes his tech-obsessed children to Asteroid City, a small, rural town to compete in a junior stargazing event. His wife, their mother, recently died which changes his world view forever. The story is presented as a play written by a famous writer. THINGS I LIKED: The cast is absolutely fantastic and knocks it out of the park. It includes quite a few Academy Award winners and nominees: Ed Norton, Adrien Brody, Willem Dafoe, Margot Robbie, Bryan Cranston, Tilda Swinton, Tom Hanks, Scarlett Johansson, Jason Schwartzman, Live Schreiber, Matt Dillon, Jeffrey Wright, and so many more! I loved Ed Norton’s fun accent. There’s even an awesome Jeff Goldblum cameo, but don’t blink or you’ll miss it. I love how the camera frames things. Each frame could be a piece of art. Just soak everything in. It’s all so clever and intentional. This is NOT one of those movies that you can have playing in the background while you do something else in the room; you HAVE to watch the screen. The introduction to the characters at the beginning was amusing. Pay attention to their descriptions. The director wanted to film out in the middle of nowhere that was flat. He looked everywhere and finally found a spot in southern Spain. I lived in Spain for 2 years and loved it! Bryan Cranston compared making this movie to an actor’s dream camp. He loved having nightly banquets with all of the other actors. Bill Murray was going to be in the movie but he got Covid-19 right before filming, so Steve Carell stepped in to fill his role. Other than West Anderson’s first movie, Bottle Rocket in 1996, this is the first movie not to feature Bill Murray. The color palette changes from black and white to fully saturated color with a retro look. The dialogue, like all Wes Anderson is witty and delivered dry. I actually like it when actors break the fourth wall. In this movie, they tell the audience, “You can’t wake up if you don’t fall asleep.” While extremely humorous, the movie is also heartbreaking. The music and sound effects are absolutely perfect. THINGS I DIDN’T LIKE: The plot is thin, as if Wes Anderson were more interested in design and creating visually stunning scenes, but they’re not really strung together in a story that the audience can sink their teeth into. There are so many characters without a clear protagonist. There’s no villain or challenge that needs to be overcome. Shifting from color to black and white is an interesting director choice, but it felt more like a distraction than was necessary. TIPS FOR PARENTS: Full frontal, female nudity (Scarlett Johansson was perfectly fine doing it but she also had to direct it because Wes Anderson was too embarrassed to do it himself. Then why did he even put that in his movie?

The story isn't very deep and only serves as a means to get to the next action sequence. The protagonist's character development is weak, we don't get a lot of background as to why they are so evil.

THINGS I LIKED: Storm Reid does a fantastic job as a quick-thinking teen who understands the power of technology. It’s great to see Joaquim de Almeida in something again. I’ve always liked him. Other cast members who do a great job include Nia Long, Tim Griffin, Ken Leung, and Megan Suri. The first couple of minutes quickly show you the dynamics of all the characters and introduce you to the technique of storytelling through various electronic devices. Even though Colombia has a terrible reputation of being dangerous, I was able to go there on a medical mission a few years ago and absolutely loved it. The country is gorgeous, and the people are warm and friendly. Shout-outs to TaskRabbit, Google, Siri, and Ring. The biggest praise goes to Mac operating systems and the world-changing iPhone. It’s a fun mystery that races you from clue to clue with many twists and turns. Ah, teens. The attitude. The technology. Technology is definitely their world, and this movie shows how quickly they can navigate anything. Fun fact: While your eyes scan news articles with the protagonist, pay attention to the quick references to a potential alien invasion. This is definitely not an alien movie, but that’s a fun Easter egg. The pace is very fast and holds your attention throughout every scene. THINGS I DIDN’T LIKE: There’s a lot of reading required because of all the texts used between characters. This is not the kind of movie you can watch in the background while you’re doing something else. You need to pay close attention because so many important things are written on the screen. Older audiences might get tired of all the reading and texting lingo. TIPS FOR PARENTS: People are shown being kidnapped. A gun is used and some people get shot. We see some blood. Some violence. There is talk of people who did crimes and went to jail. We see pictures of teens at a party with lots of alcohol and drugs.'), ('6', 'Decent movie.

The characters and performances are excellent keeping you invested into these characters and hoping to see what will happen to them all the way in the end. The writing is phenomenal since seeing and hearing some things for the first time causes your head to initially brush it off since you've seen it plenty of times before only for it all to come back later on and make you see it from a completely different perspective the second time you watch it. The foreshadowing is excellent with again how it just uses everyday actions preventing you from thinking about it all too much but when it does come back, it feels so surprising and satisfying. Finally, the webcam perspective is a genuinely unique perspective as it allows you to see the world in a completely different point of view and this perspective will allow it to stay with you for years to come. Finally, the fact that the supposed main villain gets killed pretty late into the movie when there's still more gives you the feeling that there's a much bigger threat and there's more to these characters than you initially think and it keeps you invested no matter what.

He worked as the producer, screenwriter, and director. The film follows US Army Sergeant John Kinley and his Afghan interpreter Ahmed in 2018. The movie is a powerful tribute to the many Afghan interpreters who risked their lives and reputations to serve the US Army. It has everything you want in a war movie: action, drama, emotion, realism, honor, and a lot of heart. THINGS I LIKED: I adore Jake Gyllenhaal. He is one of the best actors out there these days, so I figured this movie would be excellent simply due to his performance. I was right. He’s amazing. Will someone please give this guy an Academy Award already? He has been in several award-winning films yet has only been nominated once for Best Supporting Actor in Brokeback Mountain. I don’t think that was even his best performance in a movie! Wait until you see his monologue to his wife in this movie. Dar Salim also gave an excellent performance. We’re sure to see a lot more of him in future American movies. Both Jake Gyllenhaal and Jason Wong starred in different Jarhead movies. The rest of the cast includes Rhys Yates, Sean Sagar, Christian Ochoa Lavernia, Bobby Schofield, Jonny Lea Miller, Emily Beecham, and many more. Everyone did an outstanding job. I wondered about the title of the movie because there are already quite a few other movies named “The Covenant.” At the end of 2022, Guy Ritchie said he had changed the name of the movie from “The Interpreter” to “The Covenant.” Based on the story, it could have easily been named “The Debt” or “The Commitment”, as Jake Gyllenhaal’s character called it. Filming was done in Alicante, Spain. I lived in Spain for 2 years! The musical score by Christopher Benstead is extremely effective. Great cinematography that captures the rough terrain and lifestyles in Afghanistan. Lots of action and tension. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time. We get to learn a little bit about Afghan culture. Keep watching during the final credits to see photos of some of the soldiers and their interpreters. Some of their faces are covered to protect their identity. The movie is timely, as President Biden recently pulled the American troops out of Afghanistan…in a terribly botched manner, I might add. How he handled the withdrawal of troops was a complete disgrace to our country, but especially to our soldiers and their interpreters over there. His disastrous decisions cost many civilian and military lives, not to mention important equipment and money. There is some humor, but not too much so as to distract or change the tone of the movie. Act 3 is way more powerful than Act 1. Act 1 features some of the cliched dialogue seen in a million other Gulf War movies, but Act 3 takes this movie to a whole other level. Incredible. THINGS I DIDN’T LIKE: There are a couple of CGI moments that weren’t perfect, but I didn’t care. It would have been amazing if this were a true story. Surely, there are real events similar to what we see in the film.

Beyond that: it\'s not perfect, but definitely one of the better military movies in at least the past few years. Some of the characters were lacking, but held up by some of the major roles. Ahmed was a awesome, and so was Kinley, but both made mistakes that helped ground them from becoming John Wicks. A couple other side characters helped, and the overall story, beats, and pacing worked pretty well.

I like the overarching theme of humanity coming together and doing whatever it takes to survive. Everyone is a hero and willing to make sacrifices to ensure humanity's survival. I find the criticism of some that this is Chinese propaganda unwarranted, it's not just China saving the world, it's people from all nationalities and backgrounds putting aside their differences for once and saving the world together. All of that is great. As is fact that the story resolves over several decades throughout several big megaprojects. I have several gripes with the movie however which result in a low score. First, the film's pacing is hyperactive, making it very difficult to follow the rather complex story. I love a complicated plot, but the movie felt like one long Youtube trailer played at 150% speed jumping from one action scene to the next, without much in the way of a long term overarching plot that slowly stacks up the pieces and accumulates into a satisfying delayed payoff. It feels very much tailored to the Tik-tok generation that has no attention span and needs constant gratification by leading them through a series of hard to follow shaky-cam action scenes and explosions. There is no meaningful dialogue or character building whatsoever. Second, it's a science fiction movie and it seems to try to get the science part right, but then has lots of implausible things going on such as the moon suddenly heading for a collision with Earth, after they have spent months or even years pushing it away from Earth. It'd need the same amount of force as they have been pumping into it over all this time to decelerate it, and then some more, to make it crash down somehow. There are several other cases besides this such as automated drone missiles needing a manual detonation, that were really throwing me off. I couldn't put my finger on the third negative point I'm about to raise for a while, but after thinking through it again over the night I realized that my biggest problem with this movie is that it is rather dystopian and I end up hating humanity rather than cheering for their triumph. There is a global government that supposedly does what it needs to do in order for humanity to survive, but at the same time oppressing the people of Earth and forcing the same people into a life not worth living. We are told early on that there is tech available to upload or at least preserve people in digital form and the government is withholding it from the people. While at the same time, the people are rendered unemployed due to AI and automation, half are left to die from radiation sickness and other calamities, and the heroic ones are constantly sent to their deaths on strings of dangerous and end-of-life missions. The Earth itself is seen as being destroyed due to the megaprojects, climate change, the Earth being moved around and problems with the sun and most natural life is mentioned to be extinct at some point. If the people are left to die and suffer on such massive scale and Earth is so thoroughly ruined, then what's the point of carrying it all to Proxima Centauri? Just upload everyone and put them on the oversized USB-sticks, get the DNA of all people and plants and animals, launch all of humanity to Proxima at a fraction of the cost, and let the AI build a paradise for us. Recreating physical bodies from DNA should be a non-issue at the rest of the tech level that is being displayed throughout the movie. We are told that the government is afraid of the upload tech because they fear that people will just want to live digitally and not do anything in the physical world, well if it is such a big motivator why not use it as a reward for all the people that do the actual heavy lifting, like you know, risking their lives and dying by the hundreds to save the rest of humanity? It'd be perfect for ensuring the people's loyalty to the state as well so it'd be in the state's own self-interest to push this tech forward and roll it out to the masses. Digital Life or lie flat!

The traps themselves certainly vary in difficulty. To avoid spoilers, the range of difficulty goes from very simple tasks, that while painful are things that most determined people could accomplish, to tasks that are borderline impossible and are frankly hard to watch.

SAW III had the iconic villain die but nope the franchise continued. SAW 3D was titled the final chapter but nope the franchise continued. Somehow, this franchise managed to get to its 10th entry but is there any worth to it or is this just another pointless cash grab? Firstly, I love how this entry does something different. For the first time in the series, John Kramer himself is the main protagonist. Previous entries would usually have a protagonist who is trying to survive his traps. We get a lot more insight into his moral code and we get to see a more human side to him. One thing this film does well is make us fully in support of Jigsaw. Sometimes Jigsaw will make certain people be involved in his games but it is very questionable whether they deserve it. This is not the case in SAW X as the antagonists are just vile human beings who prey on sick individuals. Additionally, having this movie set after SAW I but before SAW II was a good choice. This meant not having any of the convoluted baggage of entries after 2. Tobin Bell returns as Jigsaw and he gives a great performance. I loved seeing him portray these new sides to John while also showing his anger towards these scammers. Shawnee Smith also returns as Amanda and seeing more of her relationship with John was a big focus in the film. Amanda is having doubts about being able to follow in his footsteps but John being a mentor and encouraging her is surprisingly heart-warming in a torture movie. I do like they also explore the idea of whether one truly deserves it or not. The scammers all have different levels of involvement in the scam, does someone with minimal involvement deserve to be in the game? They also raise the question of his moral code. John believes everyone deserves a second chance which is why his games have a chance of surviving. However, these scammers are terrible and one of them is truly unforgivable. It is doubtful they would changed if they survived. Both of these are raised by Amanda to John and build up their eventual conflict. The biggest reason anyone is watching these movies is the traps which are enjoyable enough in SAW X. They are not overly ridiculous and gratuitous like some previous entries but they are gruesome enough to make you want to look away. Nevertheless, the film does have some problems. There is a twist in the 3rd act that is a little questionable. You have to wonder why the characters bothered to take that risk when it could easily go wrong. Additionally, the conclusion is not very satisfying because it not giving a proper closure to a certain character. John also has a thing against bringing innocents into his games but in future films, chronologically, he brings people who made honest mistakes and even used a player's child as bait. John is very flippant with his code. Overall, this is one of the best SAW movies in a long time. It brings something fresh to the franchise and feels like a coherent movie.

In this vision of the future, Artificial Intelligence, as mankind’s offspring, inherits emotions, as well as this complete disdain for others, as demonstrated through the callous destruction wrought by all sides during the entire movie. Selfishness as well as a very dubious solidarity abound, leaving the keen viewer uncertain of who to emotionally support. Gareth Edwards can absolutely keep you guessing if one side is more correct than the other, right up to the very end.

I would just say don’t take this film too seriously (it’s a farce) and a very enjoyable comedy fever dream of absurdity. It has a very dark sense of humor and I couldn’t help but feel bad for this character, but over a 3 hour time span you eventually just let go and enjoy the ride.

The film was written and directed by the extremely creative Ari Aster. The film is brought to us by A24, a studio known for its unusual work. THINGS I LIKED: The movie had me at Joaquin Phoenix. He’s amazing and deserves all of the many awards he has received over the years. The terrific cast also includes Tony Award winner Nathan Lane, Amy Ryan, Parker Posey, Tony and Grammy award-winning Patti LuPone, and Zoe Lister-Jones. Director Aster definitely plays the long game with his films. While watching his mindblowing film Midsommar, I was bewildered, shocked, and horrified. In the end, I realized it was extremely clever, although it’s definitely not a movie for everyone’s taste. In this movie, Aster wants the audience to experience what it feels like to live with paranoid, emotional trauma. If you enjoy Charlie Kaufman’s surrealistic style of art, you’ll be intrigued by this film. Otherwise, this is an unusual movie that simply won’t resonate with most viewers. THINGS I DIDN’T LIKE: The director took WAY too long to say what he wanted to say. This is a very long, tiring film. The director described the film as a 4-hour nightmare. It certainly feels like 4 hours but is just under 3 hours, which is still too long and a test of an audience’s endurance, hoping for something amazing to happen. The film is confusing, indulgent, and strange. For me, it was painful to watch, knowing I could spend my time in better ways. Sure, I get the artsy-fartsy pieces and messages, but that doesn’t mean it’s my cup of tea. The music and sound effects were often both hypnotic and annoying. There really isn’t a huge plot; the movie is strung together by experiences that are designed to make you feel a variety of emotions. It made me sad to think that there are probably people out there who are experiencing life like this. Last Fall, I saw several people like that on the streets of Vancouver in Canada. Heartbreaking.

But we\'ve got some fabulous editing, great mixed media, a different kind of Phoenix shows up for this one, more subdued and quirky than ever, with a supporting cast that does just that, and does it well. Like I said, I would love to give this film a 9. And were it directed or re-written by someone like Charlie Kaufman, maybe it\'d get there?

Objectively, apart from the woke agenda, the film is average at best. Most people giving it high scores weren\'t even born when the original came out and don\'t know what good cinema looks like. And finally, I don\'t live in America but if I did, and I knew someone was trying to kill me, I\'d get a gun, like everyone else.'), ('3', 'This started really well. It had an interesting and creative opening that really engaged me. Then it gets very boring and repetitive from the opening title. I found it really unengaging, the characters were not interesting and felt really generic. The convenience store scene was a rare moment of brilliance in the bulk of the film. It actually reminded me more of Home Alone 2: Lost in New York (1992) than it did of the first Scream (1996). Why have there been so many pointless and bad sequels to one great film? I have to say though that the editing was excellent, some of the best editing in a film for a long time. There is like 15 minutes of exposition explaining who did what and why but that is so boring. Surely they could have explained it better? Anyway, another wasted potential and waste of time aside. I think they could take the last two films and combine them to possibly make one good film but why would you waste your time doing that.'), ('8', 'This is my favourite movie.

It came out 11 years after Scream 4 and it was the first to not be directed by Wes Craven. It felt like it shouldn't have worked, but it did! Now after a significantly smaller gap of just 1 year, we have another instalment in the Scream franchise. Does it continue to be a slashing entry or is this going to be the first to fall flat on its face? Firstly, I love the change in setting for this film. Bringing the franchise out of Woodsboro made this a more interesting entry. We get to see Ghostface kill in the city and that leads to a lot of interesting set pieces. A memorable one was Ghostface hiding amongst other Halloween people on a subway. These scenes are incredibly tense and suspenseful. I also love how brutal this new Ghostface is. The way they stab their victims, hunt the main characters and hurt anyone in their way is unsettling. The opening scene was also a terrific way of subverting expectations. The mystery surrounding the new Ghostface is engaging and effective in its execution. Neve Campbell does not return as Sidney for the first time in the series due to a pay dispute which is a shame. However, I think the way her character is handled is done respectfully. Her absence leads to a focus on the characters from Scream V and it makes the film a lot better. On that note, Melissa and Jenna return as Sam and Tara respectively from Scream V and I liked them more here. I liked how both characters handled the traumatic events in that film. Sam is very cautious and protective of her sister since the event but Tara just wants to move on. I especially enjoyed Sam's struggle with her inner darkness which was hinted at in the previous film. The surviving supporting cast from Scream V also has more depth this time with their friendship with Sam and Tara being more meaningful. Courteney Cox returns as Gale and despite being a small role, she has an enjoyable and tense scene with Ghostface. The biggest surprise was Hayden Panettiere returning as Kirby from Scream 4. The last we saw of her was her getting stabbed and bleeding out so it was a surprise to see her alive. I enjoyed seeing how she also changed since Scream 4. She is more hardened and resolved but unlike with Sidney, it's hard to tell if it is truly genuine or if she is Ghostface. Nevertheless, I do have some issues with it. My biggest is characters surviving fatal wounds. Some characters would get stabbed in the gut and leg but still have loads of energy to fight with no issues. You could argue that it is Adrenaline but it is kind of weird. Some characters survive getting stabbed dozens of times which is just plain ridiculous. It felt like they were scared to kill off characters. The story also relies on plot conveniences and incompetent cops. The Ghostface is hunting our main characters and none of the police think to stay with them. Once it is revealed who is Ghostface, their plan feels a bit ridiculous and also feels like it could have easily been uncovered if anyone from the police or FBI weren't dumb. Overall, Scream continues to deliver refreshing movies in the slasher genre. 6 movies in and there isn't a terrible movie in the franchise. I hope whatever future entry this franchise has, that continues to do something new and exciting.""), ('6', ""Not bad, but not great either.

Infinity Pool,"Jan 27, 2023",movie,1 h 57 m,7.2,5.9,"['Crime', 'Crime', 'Crime', 'Crime', 'Crime']",6.3,"{('7', ""With The White Lotus, The Menu and Triangle of Sadness still fresh in our minds, the moment we meet rich and bored James and Em at a posh resort, introduced in a rotating, disorienting fashion, we know things won't go well. And they don't, at all. Skarssgard is our guide through the nightmare, and he excels every step of the way, as does his nightmare companion of sorts, the excellent Mia Goth. Cronenburg continues to examine what makes us, us. And starts to put that in a blender, so to speak. It's an original, fascinating concept that gets into Ken Russell tripiness at times, but is a wild ride.""), ('5', 'Alexander Skarsgård is one of the more courageous actors working today. He’s been willing to portray unappealing characters and to take big risks with the roles he’s played. Recently, he’s been an abusive husband in TV’s “Big Little Lies,” an amoral tech CEO (I know, redundant, right?) on “Succession” and a Viking prince with anger management issues in the film “The Northman.” His role here may be his most challenging to date. In Writer/Director Brandon Cronenberg’s “Infinity Pool,” James (Skarsgård) and his wife are vacationing at La Tolqa, a fictional beachfront resort. After publishing a single, poorly-received book six years ago, James is seeking inspiration. The couple encounters Gabi (Mia Goth) and Alban, who invite them on a trip outside the compound, even though it’s strictly forbidden. Driving back drunk, James hits and kills a local resident. He’s arrested and taken by the police to a sober, concrete, Soviet-style police station where he’s presented with a choice. He can be executed for his capital crime. Or, for a hefty fee, he can be cloned and have his double die in his place. After that, the movie gets weird. As with his first film “Possessor,” Cronenberg demonstrates his skill as a provocateur. The opening visual, where the camera rotates 360 degrees, informs us early that what’s to come will be disorienting. People wear grotesque masks. They engage in orgies, although they’re more psychedelic than explicit. This is a film that’s disturbing, bewildering, upsetting and disgusting but also thought-provoking. What works here is the acting. Skarsgård shows his versatility as James (and one or two of his clones). After starring in this year’s “Pearl” and “X,” Mia Goth uses this project to solidify her status as the latest scream queen. She’s particularly skillful at compellingly portraying unhinged maniacs. What doesn’t occur is adequate development of the many themes Cronenberg addresses in the film. He clearly disdains the entitlement of rich Western travelers who inflict themselves on some of the world’s poorest but most beautiful countries. But his critique of privilege is neither as well-focused nor as insightful as what we’ve already seen in “Parasite,” “The Menu” or even “Glass Onion.” He swings and misses when given the opportunity to address the nature of humanness in the context of clones. Where he connects most powerfully is when he proposes that humans will sink to their worst instincts and impulses when placed in a world where their actions have no consequences. In 1996’s “Crash,” Writer/Director David Cronenberg, Brandon’s father, explored a subculture of people physically disfigured in car crashes. In “Infinity Pool,” Brandon Cronenberg is clearly interested in exploring a less obvious disfigurement: events that warp the psyche and damage if not obliterate the soul.'), ('9', 'A fantastic experience filled with wild imagery and performances.

From the opening scenes, it is clear that this is a movie that relishes in bringing the audience on a trippy and unforgettable journey.

As the story unfolds, we witness a couple, James and Em Foster, getting swept up in a maelstrom of body horror, twisted power dynamics, and surreal imagery that threatens to consume them entirely. The film's direction is a major strength, as Brandon Cronenberg shows signs of inheriting his father's talent for crafting visceral and unsettling visual experiences. The camera is unflinching in its depictions of extreme violence and surreal bodily modifications, yet always maintains an artistic and dreamlike aura. Cleopatra Coleman and Alexander Skarsgård deliver convincing and empathetic performances, grounding the film's increasingly bizarre narrative with moments of genuine emotion and vulnerability. With that being said, Infinity Pool is not for everyone. Its commitment to being strange and provocative can be challenging for some viewers. However, for those willing to take the plunge and immerse themselves in the film's twisted world, they will be rewarded with a uniquely imaginative and unforgettable cinematic experience. Overall, Infinity Pool cements Brandon Cronenberg as an exciting and daring filmmaker, carving out his own distinctive voice in the world of body horror cinema.""), ('8', 'No one could’ve played this role better than Goth.

I wish we'd known more about the sci-fi concept of the film — the doppelgangers — because it's very intriguing. Unfortunately, Brandon Cronenberg's screenplay gets messier as the story goes by, and the plot gets tedious by the second part. Some thoughts are very in-your-face, and the graphic images are there only for shock value most of the time. But hey, at least the trippy sequences are cool; they reminded me of the Panos Cosmatos 'Cabinet of Curiosities' episode. Also, the upper-class critique theme is oversaturated by now. We've had no shortage of these films or series in the last couple of years, and lots of them have been notably superficial. 'Infinity Pool' offers a no conventional take on the subject — although the representation of the locals as bloodthirsty individuals in rags is up to debate — but it gets underdeveloped when the writer/director starts to follow another thread, which is another problem the movie has; many ideas feel undercooked.

Telling a romantic story between two people involved in that world and working in the same hedge fund implies dealing with more than just ordinary moments of love. From the trailer, it can be anticipated that one of the central points of this plot lies in how business corrupts the lives of the main characters and how those around them, especially the female protagonist, consider others as mere disposable objects. Hence the quote I chose. The resulting dynamic between the two immediately generates feelings of resentment when she is promoted, and he is not. One begins to fall behind, and in this context, the plot development, although predictable due to the fact that it is rare for a man to tolerate his partner surpassing his work and economic achievements, whether for reasons of ego or self-esteem, suggests that the relationship has become a ticking time bomb, we just have to wait for the explosion. Admittedly, I feel that Fair Play could have addressed the tensions between the business processes and the power relations and gender in a more focused way rather than concentrating mostly on the conflict of the protagonists' relationship.

The way in which this unfolds, though, is largely laughable, despite an underlying message that has some noteworthy merit (even if it’s a bit trite in this day and age). The picture might be more worth watching if the two protagonists (Phoebe Dynevor, Alden Ehrenreich) weren’t so inherently deplorable and portrayed with some of the hammiest on-screen acting I’ve seen in a long time.

The story itself is pretty freaky and, in my opinion, is also brought to an appropriate conclusion. With this type of story, that\'s not always easy to do without it seeming too ridiculous, absurd or out of place. I would describe the film as a psycho thriller with a sci-fi touch. If you have no problems with a few jump-scares and are fed up with the typical unimaginative Hollywood flicks copied 100 times, you will surely like this movie.

The prime ability of No One Will Save You lies in its creative approach to storytelling. The absence of dialogue and reliance on sound creates a unique atmosphere. Given the story revolves around a young girl facing an alien invasion all alone in her home, developing stealthy behavior to survive is the soul and spirit of its performance. Everything goes smoothly until the first 25 minutes, and Kaitlyn Dever's character is far from a typical, helpless protagonist. She acts strategically and fights back. However, after the initial attack, the film takes a disappointing turn and begins to squander its best elements to create something even more tense and perhaps horrifying and instead goes down a path that turns what it originally set out to do into a frustrating exercise in banality that is further hindered by the total lack of narrative context for the protagonist's situation. The script is not skillful enough to sustain the tension, the suspense, and even less the empathy and investment of interest that you get to have in her. It presents a cat-and-mouse game that grows tiresome with repetition. Beyond its virtues in grounding its themes in fear, unresolved trauma and social alienation, No One Will Save You fails to provide any meaningful catharsis and this deficiency arises from its decision to rely solely on physical actions to convey emotions, as it opts for no dialogue to complement the narrative. And it's not that you can't understand what's going on but that will only get you so far, and that mistake belongs entirely to the director. Kaitlyn Dever does her best and successfully manages to bring depth to her character within the confines of her role, but the entire execution of the film fails to serve her performance well in the face of all that is lost for the background of her character. No One Will Save You certainly had ambitions to break out of the mold of both sci-fi and existential drama, but it lacks the context and qualities necessary to satisfy both narrative threads. Disappointing.""), ('7', 'Genuinely a fun experience. Horror-wise, this movie is not for me, since aliens are not the way to make me scared. But, I loved the way the concept was approached here.

My biggest gripe with No One Will Save You is its ending that feels a little rushed and a little confusing - not that you won\'t understand what\'s happening, but moreso why it\'s happening. Overall - No One Will Save You is a good balance of turn-your-brain-off jumpy horror schlock AND elevated, smart horror that just meanders a bit at the end.

Decent action packed movie if you're in the mood.""), ('6', 'If your plane is going to crashland on an Island even the nearby governments are too afraid to go near, well then it’s a good thing your pilot is Gerard Butler. Brodie Torrance (Gerard Butler) is a pilot, a father and only delighted to be on his way home to his daughter for New Years after one last flight. Well on what should have been a routine flight ends badly during a lightning strike and they are forced to “land” on a war torn Island. Better than landing on the water right? Wrong, turns out from all the places they could have landed, the Island is filled with dangerous rebels practically queuing up to get shot and battered by Gerard Butler. Turns out “the crash was just the beginning.” Gerard Butler must now find a way to get help while also protected the passengers from these dangerous criminals. Plane is a mindless action flick that writes itself, offers no real surprises but is entertaining in the moment and does the job. It’s fast paced, wastes absolutely no time getting going and is just an all-round fun movie. There’s also enough time allowed to set up the characters before things go south so you’re invested enough in the story to care what happens. The fight scenes are very well shot, none of this over the top shaky cam stuff. It’s actually clear to see each and every vicious punch to the head. It’s not exactly going to go down in history as one of the best action movies ever made but it’s enjoyable all the same. Pretty sure the only reason anyone is seeing Plane is for Gerard Butler. It’s definitely one of his better movies, and believe me I’ve seen some of his worst ones (yeah I’m looking at you Gods of Egypt), so when I say Plane is a decent movie you can trust me. If there’s one thing cinemas will never be short of is an action star thrown into a perilous situation and must save the day before it’s too late. Plane is actually what it advertises, no more and no less. If you’re looking for something different to all the award contenders right now, then look no further, Plane has you covered. Highly recommended for all the diehard Gerard Butler fans.'), ('7', 'This movie was quite thrilling and old school. The kind of action thriller the 90’s would have gave us. Gerald Butler got the most credit by the positive Rottem Tomatoes reviews. As a pilot trying to save his plane and passengers when they land on enemy territory.

There are actually 2 movies here: The flight, which is pretty gripping, and the fight, which is standard action fare. There's tension building up to the emergency landing, but once they arrive in the jungle the threats become human and not especially intimidating. The rescue attempt has lots of gunfire, but not much else. Once you've experienced the entire movie, the absurdity of the premise becomes even more ridiculous. Still, it's a passable but quickly forgotten action flight.""), ('10', 'Very successful action film of the classic kind. There is a suspense curve, the story is reasonably logical and the protagonists are believable. You can watch it with friends and beer at the weekend.'), ('6', 'Gerard Butler’s an interesting guy. He studied law at the University of Glasgow, but was reportedly fired from his first law firm one week after getting his law license. After establishing himself as an actor, Butler created a production company (it’s now called G-Base Productions) which bankrolls all of his movies. The company’s first commercial success was “Olympus Has Fallen.” It was soon followed by “London Has Fallen” and “Angel Has Fallen.” The company has no known relationship with Life Alert. G-Base’s current offering is “Plane.” Like the movie’s title, the film is a stripped-down, bare bones action film. There are no elaborate set pieces. There’s no extraneous dialogue. The main character has no love interest. Turns out, it’s satisfyingly self-sufficient. Main character a pilot. Plane flies into storm. Plane loses power. Beverage service discontinued. Plane crash-lands in jungle. Good news: plane intact, passengers survive. Bad news: island overrun by ruthless rebel militia. Passengers captured. Pilot must rescue passengers. Entertainingly predictable action ensues. There’s absolutely nothing new here. The story centers on two main characters. Veteran Captain Brodie Torrance (Butler) is flying for a low-rent airline after being caught on video choking out an unruly passenger. He is square-jawed, stoic, but also prone to introspection, of course in a totally manly way. When trying to rescue the passengers, Brodie is led/helped by Louis Gaspare (Mike Colter – “Jessica Jones,” title role in “Luke Cage”). In a surprising development, Gaspare is not a mustache-twirling Frenchman, but a formidable-looking, manacled prisoner convicted of capital murder who once served in the French Foreign Legion. Mon dieu. Both actors are excellent. There’s something refreshing about a movie willing to just do simple things well. Here, the creative team is self-confident enough to tell a story without diversion, subterfuge or distracting subplots and to still believe their effort will satisfy the audience. In other words, welcome to the 1990s. Think of “Plane” as furthering the tradition of “Con Air” and “Air Force One.” That’s not to say the finished product is flawless. At one point, Brodie voluntarily goes to the captors and offers himself in place of the captured passengers. It’s a little too messianic. But perhaps this airline has created a frequent flyer program where loyalty works both ways. If you’re looking for two hours of pleasant diversion, this film is strongly recommended. It’s ideal for the moviegoer who found “Top Gun: Maverick” a little too complicated.'), ('6', 'While there are few suprises to be found in this predictable disaster/action / survival/ thriller mashup. In spite of this it is done with such a wink and a nod to the audience that it is hard not to smile and be entertained by it all. Butler and colter shine throughout with a decent turn in from the supporting cast too.'), ('7', 'IN A NUTSHELL: This is the first movie to hit theaters in 2023. It’s the kind of fun action movie you want to watch while eating buttery popcorn and one that’s filled with cliches and plot holes, yet still an entertaining ride. Critics are calling it vapid, but audiences are loving it. Sit back, put your sense of reality in the locked position, and enjoy your flight! This action-packed flick was directed by Jean-Francois Richet who gives us lots of high-octane moments. The screenplay is by J.P. Davis and Charles Cumming. TIPS FOR PARENTS: Lots of brutal, bloody violence High dead-body count Guns, knives, and hand-to-hand combat People are in perilous situations Tagalog is spoken with subtitles Hostages THINGS I LIKED: Gerard Butler is perfect in this role. He knows how to roll with tension, action, and heart. He sure takes a beating in this one. Another name was pushed for by the studio, but Gerard Butler liked the simple title of Plane. Fun fact: The movie was actually filmed in Puerto Rico, not in Singapore or the Philippines as it states in the actual film. There’s a nice balance of action and time to breathe in between the shoot-em-up scenes. If you already don’t like to fly, this movie will terrify you some more.While the entire movie isn’t shot as a one-take movie, there are some moments that are. I always love the choreography of shots like that. The impressive camerawork is noticeable because there isn’t much CGI. It kind of felt like a fun Die Hard movie where you just can’t overthink anything in order to have a good time. THINGS I DIDN’T LIKE: There are a couple of subplot lines that don’t necessarily go anywhere other than to distract and entertain us. There are some dumb moments that will remind you of 90s action movies, but you’re still going to have fun. The villains are paper-thin and cliched.'), ('7', 'I enjoyed it - it had action, it had real settings, it had story which could be real for most of it and it was interesting to watch throughout.

I thought Plane would be no different, especially when I viewed the trailer. But yet again, I was surprised with the warm reception the film got and on Monday, I made it a point to go and watch this film. Suffice to say, just like the rest, I was surprised and impressed as well. Plane isn't just an action film. It is a thriller as well and all in all a good entertainer. Of course I am not giving away any spoilers but from what the trailer shows, it is a story centered around a Airplane Pilot Brodie Torrance (Gerard Butler) and what unfolds on new year's eve with him and his passengers and crew. The 1st half of the film is a pure thrill ride and it keeps you glued to your seat, although you know what is going to happen, you still want to see it unfold. You might think that the 2nd half of the film is gonna be a Rambo-like film but actually it isn't which is a good thing and honestly a great approach to a predictable plot. Performance wise, of course it is Gerard Butler who is the star of the show, since the entire story revolves around his character. After him it is Mike Colter who has done a good job although, he doesn't have much to do accept beat up the bad guys. The Supporting cast and do their adequate best in their respective roles. Charles Cumming and J. P. Davis who have written the script should be acknowledged because Plane is a film you go in expecting the same-old, same-old action madness but you come out satisfied because it isn't that. Director Jean-François Richet has done a good job 'merging' two genres into one. Kudos to him for this attempt and waiting to see more from him. In conclusion, Plane is a good entertainer because it tries to be different and for that I give it accolades.

I took two of my sons with me when I went on my first speaking tour. We all fell in love with the people and culture. One of them even married a lovely woman from Hong Kong and now I have an adorable grandson with Chinese in his blood! THINGS I LIKED: I\'m so happy to see Ashley Park in a feature film! I love her in the popular sitcom Emily in Paris. She\'s so talented and beautiful. Other cast members include Debbie Fan, Kenneth Liu, Annie Mumolo, David Denman, and more. There is a sweet storyline about one of the characters going to find her birth mother, yet also recognizing that her adoptive parents are amazing. It\'s fun to go to China in the movie! It\'s a beautiful country filled with rich culture, delicious food, and gentle people. THINGS I DIDN\'T LIKE: The girls are SO crude and vulgar. Why do feminists think the only way to show they are liberated is to be crass and foul? One of the girls states about the Chinese people that ""People around here can tell Chinese-Chinese from American-Chinese."" That\'s so true because Chinese-Chinese people don\'t wear loud, obnoxious colors for the most part or wear Hipster-American clothing. Chinese people are much more reserved and respectful. Characters in the movie slam white people, Americans, Chinese, Christians, and other things. Honestly, this felt like a rated X movie, so I stopped watching it long before it ended. It\'s soooo raunchy and filled with slutty tramps who respect nothing. TIPS FOR PARENTS: This sex-obsessed movie is not appropriate for kids. Lots of profanity and SO many F-bombs. The first word we hear in the movie is an F-bomb. The first word we hear a young child say is an F-bomb. It\'s supposed to be so funny, but it\'s certainly not clever. Young girls flip the bird SO many times. We see sexualized artwork that features male genitalia. Young women talk about sex and genitalia many, many, many times.

Now, he finally wants to get out of the toxic relationship and move on with his life. This dark and violent comedy was directed by Chris McKay, and written by Ryan Ridley and Robert Kirkman. THINGS I LIKED: I attended a press screener at a theater for a different movie where the trailer for Renfield showed. The audience was fairly quiet at the beginning, but as soon as Nicolas Cage appeared on the big screen, the entire audience burst out in delighted laughter. Without his over-the-top, ridiculous performance, this movie wouldn’t be nearly as entertaining as it is. He said that playing Dracula was a lifelong dream of his. He played a vampire in one of his earlier movies back in the 1980s, Vampire’s Kiss, so I guess you could say that this kind of role is in his BLOOD. ha ha The entertaining cast also includes Nicholas Hoult, Awkwafina, Ben Schwartz, Adrian Martinez, Brandon Scott Jones, Miles Doleac, and Shohreh Aghdashloo. They all do an excellent job. I wonder if it got confusing on filming days to have two leading men named Nicolas (Cage and Hoult). If nothing else, it’s a new take on the old story of Dracula. Director Chris McKay explained that he wanted this movie to be a sequel to Tod Browning’s Dracula in 1931! The marketing was supposed to reflect that connection, but it didn’t actually work. The castle seen in the movie is the same one used in the family-friendly movie Chitty-Chitty Bang Bang! It’s called Neuschwanstein, located in Bavaria, Germany. Guess what? Nicholas Cage actually owns a few castles in real life! It’s a pulp version of vampires with a lot of dark humor and comedic schtick. It’s also extremely campy, so be prepared. Shout-out to Wiccan Tumblr. Ha ha The themes and life lessons are simple and powerful. THINGS I DIDN’T LIKE: The film is extremely violent and gory. There are quite a few dark scenes at night that will make viewing difficult when watched on a small streaming device. The ending is vague enough that it leaves a crack open for a sequel.

Reptile,"Sep 22, 2023",movie,2 h 14 m,5.2,6.3,"['Crime', 'Crime', 'Crime', 'Crime']",6.0,"{('6', 'Justin Timberlake stars in Netflix’s latest thriller about a real-estate broker who has been mysteriously murdered. Benicio Del Toro is the lead investigator whose past life landed him a new detective job in Scarborough, Maine. As the story progresses and more clues become unraveled, we get the sense that nothing is really what it seems and that the movie title may be a metaphor for the overarching plot. What I would describe as a slow burn thriller, this movie had its peaks and valleys. Some scenes you absolutely had to pay attention in order to see small details while others will have you losing your attention span. Being an NSYNC fan from my youth, I wanted there to be more J.T. but he didn’t really have the prominent role that I was looking for (which is okay). I also was not really a fan of the conflicting love drama with Benicio’s character. I get the writers were probably trying to play into the snake metaphor but the movie could have done without it and been 15 minutes shorter. I will give them credit for the story development as I do not like thriller/murder mystery movies that reveal key information that’s pivotal for the plot 20 minutes before the ending, making it impossible to guess the killer prior. Overall, I would rate the movie at a 6.1. While the story was a bit underwhelming it did have me hooked and guessing who the killer was. I ultimately was incorrect about the killer so my rating has to go up because of that. I did appreciate the scene where the cops were betting on who they thought the killer was. I found it to be a nice comic relief considering the dark tones of the film. I thought Benicio was by far the best actor in the film but his questionable backstory never came to really matter at all so I have to take some points away for that. My attention span was also waning in a couple scenes and that’s never a good thing when it comes to a slow burn thriller. The film also had some great intense scenes that I couldn’t look away from the screen, so points added for that. In review, I would recommend this movie to anyone looking for a low drama and somewhat intense murder mystery. Netflix films tend to be good but not great films, and this would fall perfectly into that category. TL;DR: 6.1/10 film with a nice twist. Slow burn and intense film that had me guessing throughout. Benicio is the star but his story arc feels lacking.'), ('1', ""It's just so bad. Filled with random.images and scenes that mean nothing. A stupid plot that makes no sense.

It begins to dismantle the illusions in his life. This is the directorial debut of Grant Singer. He also wrote it with Benicio Del Toro and Benjamin Brewer. Benicio Del Toro also stars in it with Justin Timberlake, among others in the great cast. THINGS I LIKED: Others in the cast you’ll love seeing are Alicia Silverstone, Frances Fisher, Eric Bogosian, Domenick Lombardo, and Ato Essandoh. We all know Justin Timberlake has some serious pipes, but he also does a fantastic job in all of his acting roles. Fun fact: he’s wearing brown contact lenses in this role. Benicio Del Toro and Alicia Silverstone dated in real life for about a year. They also appeared together as love interests in the movie Excess Baggage in 1997. Unlike most detective movies, they actually have a good married in this movie. Pay attention to all of the clues. They’re hidden cleverly. There is some subtle humor to make the characters endearing. I love twists and turns. There are plenty of red herrings that will try to divert your attention to the wrong suspects, of course. THINGS I DIDN’T LIKE: Like a snake, Act 1 moves very slowly, but then, things really pick up and hit you over the head. It’s really much longer than it needs to be.

It’s not appropriate for them anyway Profanity, including F-bombs An unmarried couple lives together, even though the woman is already married.T alk of a brutal murder, and portrayal of murder.

However, once the fundamental questions are raised, we are faced with a dilemma: either the script reveals itself to be intriguing and insightful enough to keep the viewer on the edge of their seat, fully immersed in the unfolding plot, or it simply requires one to pay minimal attention to its details to decipher what is going on in a matter of minutes. Unfortunately, in the case of Reptile the second option is the prevailing one. This puzzle is distinguished by its remarkable simplicity; in fact, it demands very little from the audience, as it lacks the subtlety necessary to effectively present its plot. It is abundantly clear that, even as it attempts to persuade us that there is a conspiracy of far greater proportions than what is actually occurring, its own characters expose the truth without the need to dig deeper into the mystery. It's surprising to note that Benicio del Toro was involved in the writing of the script, and his contribution as an actor stands as the strongest point of this narrative. However, it seems that giving an equal weight to the development of the other characters wasn't considered, and the film suffers the consequences of this lack of equity. The climax materializes in the last fifteen minutes, although I had already identified the perpetrators an hour earlier. The motives only become clear a little later in the plot.

Plots are kind of thin sometimes but ok other times. A Columbo structure (we know who did it up front) while she solves the crime. Kind of stupid that she puts herself in danger each show and escapes with great luck. We\'d rate it ""give it a try and you may like it.""'), ('8', '(Ep 1 ""Dead Man\'s Hand"" + Ep 2 ""The Night Shift"") A waitress named Charlie with a gift for detecting deception gets recruited by a casino boss to exploit a high-roller\'s poker game, while she deals with her friend\'s violent murder. Charlie then hits the road, but finds herself poking around the apparent wrongful arrest of a helpful trucker she meets at a remote rest stop. Charlie is played by Natasha Lyonne as a Columbo-type sleuth who is also a self-described dumbass. Like Columbo she is usually an apologetic and unthreatening interrogator, but unlike Columbo you know that sometimes she is not just PLAYING dumb. She keeps stumbling into obstacles or solutions without knowing how or if she can master or learn from the experience. The nominal hook for the series is Charlie\'s seemingly infallible gift for smelling out intentionally deceptive utterances. That ability gets less focus in the initial episodes than one might expect, and is downplayed by Charlie herself as a source of frustration and confusion.I expect from Rian Johnston\'s past screenwriting that POKER FACE will eventually mine the premise for clever twists and payoffs. However, that isn’t strongly evident in the openering stories. They presumably have to focus more on establishing the character and the series\' plot arc. These lean engaging and clear mystery/crime storytelling that is still pretty conventional. If anything, POKER FACE is more distinguished by how Charlie\'s amateur investigator status lends dramatic weight to her personal confrontations with perpetrators. This show is a great vehicle for Natasha Lyonne\'s anti-glamorous screen persona as a bed-headed working-class day-drinker. She gets the best moments in the episodes viewed: an excited off-screen reaction to a luxurious private chamber; and a charming delivery of the line, ""I\'m gonna... accept this situation."": her bemused reaction to waking up somewhere unexpected. A low-expectations attitude to her abilities and to looming threats make her an exception to the variously committed and well-resourced law-enforcement and P.I. types who populate crime shows. It makes it harder for writers to insert high stakes into her stories, but it does make her more relatable. By default she wants to ignore people\'s lies and manipulations and avoid involvement, but she is torn by the impulse to keep poking her nose where it is not welcome because something just doesn\'t feel right. Rather than being a crime buster straight out of the gate, she is going to have to learn as she goes without much support. You could say that Charlie is the detective character updated for the current generation living in the casual-employment/gig-work/side-hustle economy. Outside of the likeable lead, most of the other elements of the series are pretty solid, if occasionally requiring some commitment from the viewer . The hour-plus run times that streaming makes possible enabled lots of setup for ongoing character arcs in episode one but also was used to lay out multiple additional characters in the new setting Charlie arrives at while on the road in episode two. Hopefully the episode scripts get a bit tighter as the series progresses. The first two episodes use a version of the crime solving narrative format used in Columbo and Law and Order: Criminal Intent. That is, we are shown up front the events of the crime, and the question to be resolved is not whodunnit but how close will they get to getting away with it before the investigator gets involved and then catches them out. The specific non-linear narrative structure used here - in which the action starts with the crime then the timeline flashes back to before Charlie crosses paths with those events - could quickly get old if repeated consistently. (Unless, perhaps, the writers play around with some variations of it.) The show’s production has a retro feel, utilising seventies/eighties era colours and fonts for the credits, and a tendency to lean on in-camera or otherwise low-tech methods to add expressive visuals. For example, a youth’s alienation is flagged by shooting his point of view watching a flirting couple through the smudged pane of a frosted refrigerator door in a store. The success of the show will depend on how well it combines an ongoing arc for Charlie with standalone crime of the week stories. There is apparently a packed cast of name actors slated for future episodes. John Ratzenberger in episode two provides a solid but non-showy performance in a supporting role, while the casino boss in ep one gave Adrian Brody a chance to deliver a dense backstory in the enjoyable form of a rhythmically flowing yarn. So, the uses the guest cast are put to will probably vary. The mildly taxing screen time demands of setting up a new scenario in each episode lost them half a star. Otherwise episodes went down easy, combining humour and dramatic tension in clear and enjoyable ways. This is almost certainly a worthwhile series to follow.')}","{(9.1, 'You could accuse Poker Face of lacking ambition by drawing so heavily on the past, but that would be missing the point.

(And a great game too!) Thirteen years and one divorcé later, both the comics and film have, my most measures, been critiqued more than any other piece of media this past decade. Culture critics alike have lampooned the series, notoriously Negative XP\'s song \'Scott Pilgrim vs. the World Ruined a Whole Generation of Women\' that pokes at the scene girls of that era. And while I may have some distain for this hyperbolic analysis, the comics and movie certainly aren\'t without their own flaws. While Scott might\'ve completed his hero\'s journey, having him win Ramona at the end didn\'t feel like the right ending to what was already very toxic relationship. Something was missing from this arc. When an animated series was announced, produced by Edgar Wright and Bryan Lee O\'Malley, animation by famous Japanese studio Science SARU... AND all the original cast back to voice their respected roles, there was much anticipated buzz about Scott Pilgrim being back in a public eye. But what would that look like? Scott Pilgrim Taking Off left me confused at first, pleasantly surprised later, and falling in love with every single one of these characters again. Between the meta-humor and callbacks, much of this series charm comes from that Episode 1 twist. I\'m glad that I wasn\'t spoiled and, while far from perfect, what we got was wonderful reunion that left me wanting more from this project. Without spoiling too much... Scott needed to be gone for a few episodes to address the flaws that I mentioned earlier. Giving Ramona her time to confront her ex’s allowed us to develop both them and her. Showing us that Bryan really cares about these characters. That they still live inside his head. He could’ve easily done a 1:1 adaptation, but the same hyperbolic criticisms of Ramona and Scott’s relationship would still exist. Just Garden State 2.0 Animated. We often forget that it was nothing short of a miracle that the movie by Edgar Wright even exists. If you prefer the movie over the animated series, more power to you. Just keep this one thing in mind... This series is way more than just about Scott Pilgrim. It\'s about a nerdy, neurodivergent kid from Canada who learned to have respect for himself. Who found love, got married, and later divorced. His story, however, isn\'t the the first and last of it\'s kind. Whoever the next Scott is... I hope to see you in Season 2.

I\'d recommend to watch the movie before the show.--------- General Opinion: The show is fun, beautifully animated, heartwarming, and the music and sound design are on point. There are scenes that live rent-free in my memory like the first of \'Whatever\' or the fighting scene of \'Ramona rents a video\'. And some jokes make me chuckle when I randomly think about them, like: ""I am Scott"" and ""Emotional business, find me a witness"". ------------Characters: At first I was kind of disappointed because the show leaves on the bench characters that I love from the books. But we already got the story of those. So, after realizing what the show was doing, I was glad to see the anime focusing on others. Todd and Envy are a weird case. As they were well developed in the books, now they serve as support characters for Wallace. I wish they had something more going on. -----------Conclusion: I am divided in my opinion on the show. On the one hand, I feel like it misses the opportunity to gather a new audience as its metanarrative is highly dependent on the movie. On the other, I was hyped, surprised, and highly entertained. The changes on the anime were worth but I still prefer the books. I wonder if I would feel different if the marketing had been honest. ------------ One foot note I need to express: Bryan Lee O\'Malley shows his personal struggles in Scott Pilgrim, leaving gaps for you to fill with your own.

This new series stars Dominique Fishback as a stan who takes things to extremes in a very dark and unsettling way. It\'s virtually impossible to discuss this without a spoiler, so if you don\'t want to know more STOP READING. Turns out that this disturbed young woman determines to kill anyone who isn\'t a big fan of her beloved Beyoncé-type singer. Yes, she is a Black female serial killer. Fishback gives it her all, but the character doesn\'t get much depth to generate empathy (Billie Eilish does a nice job in her role). Being that Glover is involved, this isn\'t the usual serial killer series.

Especially because of the trauma that triggers it. On the other hand, there is also a noticeable plot deadlock when the main character stops advancing. Every episode her situation changes, but she doesn't. She remains the same killer until the end of her more than ambiguous conclusion and therefore the story loses freshness and the focus becomes exhausted because you can only wait to see in the last episodes who she is going to kill and what was the reason that provoked her.

Dominique Fishback as Dre was as dedicated to her character as she could be, dishing out new layers to Dre with each episode.

This show doesn't go through the entire roster of characters, but it does pick the best of the bunch from the First video game list and creates a loosely based Real Life adaption of that. Some of the characters include Roadkill, Twister, Calypso, Sweet Tooth and a few others. They absolutely nailed the Sweet Tooth character - I was worried at first, but if you really consider the dark nature of his character in the game, it's clear that he is also twisted in the mind and the TV show really does capture that and gives him quite the very hilarious backstory as well. Overall, the show is funny and keeps you entertained the entire time with only a few episodes being boring.

I’ve been a diehard Frasier fan for most of my life and frankly the idea for this series is perfect. My mom passed away last month, this was our favorite show together growing up. I got her the Blu-ray’s last year for Christmas, we watched it together before she got diagnosed with lung cancer. I remember her saying her only issue with Frasier is how could he stand at not living closer to Freddy? I genuinely feel like people need to chill out and give season one a chance to breathe. I can already tell it’s gonna be a solid season. As someone else pointed out on here, season one of the Office US did not review well, their trying to find their footing right now, and I want to see them find it to, grateful for a few more seasons with such a loved character like Frasier.'), ('10', ""It's such a good show.

Some things never change, but in otherways, his focus is different., I also appreciate as someone who rebelled hard against one of my parents as well, Freddy feels like a logical outcome as Frasier, though loving, has always been self-absorbed and obsessed with outward things. I like the new cast, it's fun seeing how Frasier fits into their lives and vice versa, it's a solid beginning to something new, the only character I struggled with was his Nephew feels a little out of place, but I'm open to it, and it seems like a fun actor playing the role. Genuinely excited for the rest of season 1!""), ('9', ""I thought the first episode was a little sloppy in places, I did find the beginning of the second episode a little sappy. But you know what? I like it. I like it a lot. I had moments where I forgot I was watching the new show and thought I was watching Frasier. It was good, and the new cast is already growing on me. I was sad the Niles and Daphne didn't have any cameo at all, and their son is by far the most under developed character as he's in the least amount of scenes, and they play him as a caricature of his parents since their missing. Still, I'm grateful the show is on the air, gives me something very different to watch these days. Keep in mind one the top shows today is literally about naked people on an island dating lol I miss this more wholesome stuff, plus watched it with my dad, big Frasier fan himself, and he was like it was okay, not bad, just okay and he told me he was just glad to see Kelsey Grammer back doing such a beloved character again, I'll make sure to come back and update this by the end of this first season, here's hoping it just gets better and better from here!""), ('9', 'What show were these critics watching? It’s literally Frasier but now. The cringe factor seems to be more about protest over it not literally being cast as a direct sequel to season 11 of Frasier. Frankly I’ve watched those 11 seasons to death. I welcome new characters interacting with Frasier, and as much as I miss Martin Crane, not much we can do about that now. I do appreciate them trying to mirror what made the last series so successful. A father and son trying to build a life were they valued being close to each other. Looking good, Frasier, looking forward to the rest of this season and watching all these episodes with my dad too.'), ('10', 'The original show is my favourite show of all time, and I regard it as one of the best comedies ever written—as do many. So naturally, I was both excited and terrified when I heard it was coming back. Now that it\'s here, and I\'ve had a chance to see the first two episodes, I\'m optimistic. It\'s the same in some ways, different in others, and I get the impression that a tad more thought and care has gone into it than is the norm these days. I can appreciate that, at the very least. Kelsey is great, but the guy played Frasier for twenty years, then spent the next twenty years doing impressions of him for every second fan he met. So yeah, he gets it, he could portray the character whilst in a coma, enough said; there was never a chance he\'d be what let the show down. The rest of the characters are all competently acted even if conservatively conceived. Clearly the intention is to replicate the main archetypes from the original show. As I said, that\'s a very conservative choice, but okay, I can roll with it. I don\'t particularly care if an idea is original, just that it\'s well executed. Over the first two episodes, it\'s impossible to call, but there\'s a decent foundation that can be built upon. The writing is solid, but you can tell it\'s been written in a different day and age. There are some definitive ""old-school"" Frasier moments that conjure up or lean more on nostalgia, as well as more contemporary touches that would feel right at home in any other modern sitcom, but that will stand out to fans of the original. The latter aren\'t bad, just different, more mainstream. Given time, this new melding of tone could end up being the originality that the fundamental ideas lack. Plot-wise I must admit, the stories from both episodes hit me in the feels. This might be where my objectivity fades and I ""fanboy out"" a bit. You have been warned. Freddy relating to his grandfather\'s death on another level in episode one struck a chord. A touch contrived, maybe, but the weight of John Mahoney\'s impeccable portrayal of Martin hung over that whole scene so it was earned nonetheless. We can only imagine how proud Martin was of his firefighting grandson, so it fits. The flag from Martin\'s casket helping to build the bridge between Frasier and Freddy was amazing (my wife was in tears). The father and son in this episode aren\'t as estranged as Martin and Frasier were—nor would it make sense if they were—they just needed a dash of common sense. Martin was always full of that. The second episode was even more impressive than the first, culminating in the most satisfying Darth Vader parody I\'ve ever seen. Frasier contriving the ridiculous story of Freddy\'s lineage to help his son save face in front of his friends was such a Frasier thing to do. How many times have fans seen Frasier relentlessly pursue something out of pure selfishness, only to turn his attention to a person more in need because of his good nature (i.e. ""The 1,000th Show"", ""Death Becomes Him""). He could have rubbed it in more, or taken the moment entirely for himself, but that\'s not the Frasier we know and love. When push comes to shove, Frasier won\'t throw anyone under the bus whatever the cost to him personally. The fact that the writers and show-runners seem to know that, gives me hope… just maybe, they all get it, and will do the show justice. I\'m giving it a 10, not because it was perfect, but because nothing about it detracted from my experience so much that I was anything other than overjoyed about having more Frasier to watch. And that\'s the point, ultimately… it feels like I\'m watching a continuation of something worthwhile, and no reboot of a TV show I\'ve seen before now has ever felt that way. Reboots of this caliber should be the norm and are instead the exception, which is very saddening.'), ('10', ""I don't normally leave reviews here, but I saw the absolutely ludicrous critic scores and actually got a little offended by how their talking about Kelsey Grammer and this new show. It is not perfect, I found the first episode to be pretty rough in places, Freddy is going to take some time to grow on me, I can already see this; not the actor's fault, the way they write him, makes him feel cruel when in fact he's really just embarrassed and defensive, is that ever fun to watch? As for the show itself, I can confidently say that by the end of episode 2 I was really charmed by it all. I felt like enough time had passed that Frasier felt like a character coming back to, I love how their is this whole missing chapter in his life getting teased out in discovery dialog, and visually as he buys something most us wouldn't even be able to afford to rent. I won't go on too long here, I just wanted to say, in my humble opinion, this isn't trying to be True Crime Season 4 here; this is a family-friendly sitcom filmed in front of a live audience like a little play put on once a week, it's cute and very fun, and I feel like the critics come off like a bunch of boring jaded monsters who've forgotten how to enjoy simple things. Reminds me honestly of the critic in Pixar's Ratatouille. Lastly, I will just add that Kelsey Grammer has since the first run of Frasier, become pretty loud about his political leanings, you do have to wonder when you see almost all the negative reviews seem to be coming from the most far-left publications. It's not a good look. Just go watch it for yourself!""), ('0', 'First two minutes in and the laugh track just makes it all cringy.

They can't handle him having any more success than he already did. (Literally, all the worst reviews read like a list of the top media giants in the country, as if they are all repeating a scripted response). Look, it's a fresh series with James Burrows in the Director's Chair, the co-creator of Cheers and The Mary Tyler Moore Show, it will continue to get better and better the more room it gets to breath, and I have high confidence it will land well by the end of season 1 with most people, and season 2 like all good sitcoms will be in part based on the feedback of season 1. Remember this, Season 1 of the Office barely managed a higher score then this and still to this day sits at a 66.

It's literally more of Kelsey Grammer playing Frasier, except now it's twenty years later, he got Bibi Blazer's dream famous, walked away, and realized he failed Freddy.

This killed momentum on a lot of the original cast returning. Honestly, it's better for it; it's forced the writers to get more creative.

The internet has really ruined simple, straightforward family comedy in the last five years. People don\'t watch TV anymore to watch it. They watch to complain about it online. This is pretty much Frasier at his best with a surrounding cast that can\'t keep up. And that\'s exactly what the original Frasier was, too. Ross was never as funny as people remember.

You may have met this person before. Daisy oozes unearned privilege. The counterpart, Billy Dunn, is supposed to be equally insufferable as the micromanaging band leader. But Billy does what it takes to be a success, and spoiler alert, he mostly does it sober! This kind of asymmetrical love/hate relationship just didn’t work for me. I find the real story of rotating relationships and hurt feelings to be much more interesting. A big criticism of the show is the music. The made up hits just don’t work.

This leads to numerous flashbacks that start to unravel the mystery. Unfortunately, the scenario is too twisted yet repetitive and ultimately confusing.

If in the case of ""The Idol"" low marks were given by both the press and the audience, in the case of ""Crowded Room"" only film critics were dissatisfied. The plot tells about an unpopular teenager Danny, who because of problems in his family and some circumstances is forced to move into a strange house, where in addition to him and the owner lives a girl Ariana. Danny and Ariana decide to attack one person. According to their plan, Danny was supposed to kill this man, but he does not dare to do so. Ariana takes his gun away from him and starts shooting, without aiming very hard, and hits him in the shoulder. Soon the police arrive and Danny is able to escape, but in the evening he is arrested on charges of shooting at Rockefeller Centre. Further plot development will be relayed through the main character\'s flashbacks during interrogations with a psychologist named Raya Goodwin, which reminded me of the narrative system from Mafia: The City of Lost Heaven (also known as Mafia: Definitive Edition). Each episode of this series keeps the viewer in suspense, immersing them in Danny\'s story. The plot of the series is full of plot twists and turns, intriguing the viewer. Near the end of the third series, after learning more about the reasons for their actions, I developed sympathy for the main character. In this series, Tom Holland has demonstrated his outstanding acting skills to date. He has shown that he can successfully handle playing blockbusters like the Marvel films as well as serious and multifaceted roles like in this series. I also hope that this is not Tom\'s last challenging and interesting role, and that we will see him with a well-deserved Oscar in his hands in the future. The costumes in the series are very good, in addition to being appropriate to the time period of the series (late 70\'s), they also better reveal the characters and show their essence. In general, the series ""Crowded Room"" is a noteworthy work. It has an exciting plot, high quality acting and skilful embodiment of characters.

This includes intense, intimate sex scenes and lots of depraved actions, including torture. All this is supposed to give us insight into the star's feelings, while creating an oppressive cult-like environment. This has gone much further in every direction than Euphoria, but it feels intentionally provocative and shamelessly prurient. Although Depp and the other actors handle the serious intent well, the whole enterprise feels sordid more for effect than for introspection. BTW, the final ep wraps things up in an absurdly happy ending.""), ('8', 'The Idol is pure aesthetic. Drugs and erotism, love and death, art and life.

Sam Levinson was once again able to present us with an unusual story. Lily-Rose Depp plays her role superbly, in my opinion, even somewhere on the level of Zendaya in Euphoria. Perhaps not everyone will like her acting, but I was definitely impressed with her. And what about The Weekend? For a character who is likely to be with Jocelyn all the time in future episodes, he doesn't have much screen time at the time of the first episode (he appeared closer to the middle of the series). But his acting abilities can already be appreciated. All in all, it's not bad for a debut, but there's room to grow. Although I don't think this series is better than Euphoria yet, I did manage to enjoy it yesterday. However, it's difficult to draw definitive conclusions about the series after just one episode. It will need more time to be fully evaluated, but I'm inclined to give it a higher rating than what the critics have given it.""), ('1', ""Could have been good. If Tedros did not exist, if the writing was better, if they spent more time hashing out plot instead of cheap sex and torture scenes. And if we're gonna do sex scenes, can they at least be good ones?
