The nuances of Oppenheimer's changing attitude before and after the creation of the bomb are worth savoring. They might not conform to typical dramatic patterns, but are truer to reality in my opinion. The visual and audio effects are on par with Nolan's other films. I highly recommend watching in an IMAX theatre for the best experience. However, apart from the points mentioned above, the story has a somber tone; it's not a light-hearted or optimistic movie. Also, characters other than Oppenheimer aren't as fleshed out. The second most developed character might be Strauss, but he's not as convincing as Oppenheimer and is far less intriguing. In particular, his righteous aide at the end came across as both annoying and unrealistic. The above critiques are minor, so I won't dwell on them. For the overall experience: the depiction of the bomb, the insights into humanity's peaks and valleys, and the exceptional visual and audio effects, I give it a 9/10.""), ('10', 'I wonderful work of art from Nolan, and one of the finest works of the decade'), ('1', 'SO BORING! too much !! Too long and what is the point of that movie ???? Really not a good moment for me…'), ('0', 'An American movie that tries to redeem men that have countless souls on their shoulders. No respect for the victims whatsoever, no wonders it was banned in Japan. Hope that America stop doing such movies.'), ('10', 'This movie is a work of art like no other, but you have to go in with the right expectations. Don\'t expect action, don\'t expect the whole movie to be about the A-Bomb, and don\'t expect the movie to be sappy and emotional. The movie is about J. Robert Oppenheimer, not the bomb. If you go in with the wrong expectations, this movie will be mediocre and boring. First, I have to note that the pacing is quite fast, even with the 3 hour runtime. You need to be able to keep up with it or you will lose track of the stuff going on. DO NOT turn your brain off and enjoy it, you need to think. Think about what all of the characters are doing, why they\'re doing it, look into their eyes and at their face and get into their head, especially Oppenheimer. Most of the emotion in this movie is through expressions and undertones, not ultra sappy scenes or dialogue, and the actors do an AMAZING job at conveying all of it. To truly understand the emotion in this movie you need to dig deep into the layers of every scene. Additionally, the use of B&W film really brings out the true ""colors"" of every scene with Strauss. It adds so much to the film and puts a line between Strauss and Oppenheimer as people. From the beginning of the movie with a younger Oppenheimer, to the amazing end of the movie, you can feel everything Oppenheimer and company is thinking and feeling. Overall the movie does a superb job at telling Oppenheimer\'s story. I don\'t expect everyone to rate this movie a 5/5, as I am a bit of a history and physics nerd, but you should recognize the masterpiece it is.'), ('9', ""Comming to Oppenheimer with one of my relatives I thought I would be bored out of existence. It turned out to be an almost perfect movie about a great man, with extremely talented cast, clever playwriting and good music to back it up. If you are scared of it being a wikipedia about the Man himself, It kind of is, but to be honest, the way Nolan wrote the movie, you don't feel bored at all. If you are expecting a Marvel quality movie, then you will be disappointed. This movie is great in what it does good, and does not need crazy one liners or action scenes to stay good throughout. 9/10""), ('9', 'Beautifully shot and true to history.'), ('10', ""Its literally a great movie about boon and history. It's really better than barbie to be honest but still watch it""), ('8', ""Due to its nature, Oppenheimer may not become one of Nolan's best films. Its slow-burn storytelling and relatively less action might play a role in that. Nevertheless, the tale it tells focuses on history's most crucial invention that jeopardizes our existence. Nolan crafts a narrative by dividing the story into three parts, keeping the excitement alive. The film is an enthralling journey that includes notable figures like Einstein and Enrico Fermi. Although not entirely factual, the film's message, particularly conveyed through President Harry Truman, illustrates what Nolan intends to portray. Thank you, Nolan.""), ('7', 'Its alright.')}"

You have to accept that there is no story, it’s just a series of events tied to a moralistic message, but it’s fun and lighthearted and there’s quite a lot of well written jokes and fun musical scenes. The only gripe I have is that they didn’t seem to know what to do with the ending, it turns into a weird pseudo Matrix Reloaded where the Architect/maker uses word salad in a failed attempt to clarify the meaning of…. Whatever… Other than that we loved it. I can see why this gets mixed reviews though, for some people they may feel exposed or roasted by the comedy and not everyone has a sense of humour about them selves.

Ken steals the show and Margot Robbie is a wonderful Barbie.'), ('0', 'This movie provides a very negative and distorted view of the male mindset and portrays this to women as the world we live in. Equality and empowerment is NOT a zero-sum game; by treating it so this movie basks in the same type of hypocritical stereotyping it feigns to fight against, thus the makers of this movie are no better than the chauvinists they take aim at all movie long. Heavy on the preaching, inaccurate on the portrayal of men, and light on story. Awful and hateful movie.'), ('2', 'This is by far the worst movie I’ve seen in recent memory. I can’t explain it, it’s just terrible'), ('1', ""Toxic femininity versus toxic masculinity. Who lost? Viewer. In short, I'm furious. If it’s detailed, I’ll tell you now, trying to avoid spoilers. Unfortunately, I can’t tell you the plot. So let's move straight to the film's shortcomings, of which I found exactly seven.First. Throughout the film, director Greta Gerwig asks questions and raises issues. She says that the real world is one of men in power and women only playing a secondary role. In Barbieland it's the other way around. However, the plot “turn of the arrow” teaches neither one nor the other anything! The picture shows how terrible it is to live under patriarchy, but demonstrates that matriarchy is the same horror, but in reverse. According to Gerwig, a world where everyone is happy is impossible.Second. At the beginning we see that Barbie is a whole universe where there are separate dolls for each race and profession. But then from the lips of one heroine we hear that in fact, Barbie introduces impossible ideals into the minds of children. As a solution, we are offered a “regular Barbie” without a profession, so that she can decide for herself what to become - but why then are all the other dolls needed, since they are so bad? Does this mean the world doesn't need a Wheelchair Barbie or an Astronaut Barbie?Third. Nobody needs Ken. At the beginning, Gosling's character is tormented by unrequited love for Barbie. He tries to get away from the lack of attention through denial and creepy attempts to introduce patriarchy into Barbieland. But in fact, he just wants to live peacefully with Barbie and receive her attention. Instead, the Kens are taken away from their power and driven back under the bunk, not allowed to play any role in the life of Barbie society. I honestly feel sorry for Ken-Gosling.Fourth. During the course of the film, we are shown that Barbies are happy to be second! They are ready to wear short skirts and carry Kenam beer. Their opinion is changed only by a lecture about how bad it is to be under the heel of men. Why was it necessary to show that Barbie herself is cool to be at her beck and call? And why deprive them of such luxury if it’s normal for them? Gerwig, how do we understand this?Fifth. As the film progresses, nothing in the world changes. Barbie has no influence on real women, Mattel management is made up of men who act like clowns. By the way, there is only one adequate man in the film, and no, it’s not Ken. Then why was all this?Sixth. The film suddenly shows that 1) being pregnant is terrible and 2) being a man who does not live up to masculine ideals is terrible. The first is shown through a pregnant doll, from which everyone stays away for some reason throughout the film. The second is through Michael Cera's character, who doesn't like the Kens' ideas or the Barbie ideas. He just lives on his own and wants to get into the real world, because there is no place for him in Barbieland. Question: WHY does the film show such things?And seventh. When given new opportunities, what is the first thing Barbie does? No, he doesn’t go to defend women’s rights, he doesn’t look for his destiny, but he goes to the gynecologist! The epic of feminism does not give women new rights; instead, the doll acquires new biological characteristics. That's all the film wanted to tell us.I hope at least some of you enjoyed reading this. I'll go see something good, but I forbid you to spend money on Barbie. Better buy a book. Or a glass of coffee.""), ('6', ""I don't know. First I want to say that Margot Robbie and Ryan Gossling did a great job and that's the main pro here. The main con here is the plot. This movie is so so confusing. I mean, at the beginning I understand the story, but as the end comes by, I really have no idea what's going on. Confusing. Really confusing.""), ('7', 'A hilarious spectacle of cinema, I was giggling throughout! Was hoping for more action scenes from my boy Ryan ""Drive"" Gosling but it\'s not that type of movie. I was elated to see all the young girls dressed in pink at my showing!'), ('3', 'A sloppily written hypocritical mess.'), ('1', ""This woke hollywood trash needs to just go away. The writing for this movie is beyond terrible. With this kind of budget and number of stars, they need to do better. Giving it 1 star for Margot's performance and the visuals but beyond that it is absolute garbage.""), ('1', ""Barbie is a cultural revenge movie complaining about how hard it is being a woman and blaming men throughout the entire movie for all their issues with ridiculous over-exaggeration of negative stereotypes. I went into the movie with the understanding there would be some of it but I've never seen a movie be so heavy-handed in driving that message. This is a very ugly movie with rage and bitterness disguised with bright colors.""), ('4', ""Not really sure why I stuck it out to the end, perhaps the Hollywood star power? The interesting aesthetic? Whatever the reason its now time I won't recoup. The writing was bad, the messaging was worse and sadly enough it just wasn't that fun to watch. If only Hollywood could just do something right for a change!""), ('6', ""In my opinion, Barbie is a fun and happy movie that children can watch with their families, but the problem is that the point of this movie is not the Barbie doll. It can be said that there are feminist ideas in this movie, which I don't think is suitable for children at all, and even the ending of this movie separates the two genders or literally discriminates between the sexes. Overall, in my opinion, Barbie is a The movie is average and cheerful, nothing more""), ('10', 'Barbie is a splendid film with storytelling made to trick its audience while also providing enough color and humor for a satirical adventure.'), ('7', 'while not the profound protest against patriarchy some like to paint it as, Barbie did put a reasonable effort into promoting feminism and is also for the most part an entertaining watch.'), ('0', 'Men are predators, women are victims. I got it. Expected a real movie'), ('10', 'Genuinely fantastic.'), ('7', 'Barbie is one of the most iconic toys of all time! It genuinely baffled me that it took this long for there to be a Barbie film. Barbie isn\'t my thing, so I wasn\'t interested in watching this. It wasn\'t until the first trailer came out and the global internet cultural phenomenon ""Barbenheimer"", the release of Barbie and Oppenheimer on the same day, that my interest was piqued. So is life plastic, it\'s fantastic? Or is it just Ken? Firstly, casting Margot Robbie as Stereotypical Barbie was perfect! She is incredibly charming and earnest in the role. She conveys a naive yet caring nature to her character while being very funny at times. Ryan Gosling as Beach Ken is also perfect casting! He is the greatest highlight with his hilarious physical performance. Every time he is on screen, he brings the laughs. Ryan also conveys a vulnerability to Ken which is surprising. Margot and Ryan have a fun chemistry together! This film has a huge cast with many playing other variations of Barbie and Ken. They are all good in their limited screen time but the stand out is Michael Cera who plays Ken\'s best buddy Allan. I just love how different he is from the others and how he manages to be so lovable in his limited screen time. From the first 30 minutes, you will notice the amazing costumes and set designs. Barbieland itself looks like a Barbie toy set brought to life. The massive amount of pink covering the world, the plastic look of all the accessories, houses and cars. Every Barbie and Kens clearly had a lot of thought put into their costumes because no Barbie and Ken look the same. Every costume manages to reflect the type of Barbie and Ken they are. The music score is great and the use of vocal songs was utilized effectively. Special mention to ""I\'m Just Ken"" sung by Ryan Gosling! Some great dance scenes are entertaining to watch with their fun choreography. It is a comedy at heart and there are quite some funny jokes and moments with a surprising amount of great adult jokes. I also love how they poke fun at Mattel and even Barbie as a brand which is a bold move. Despite that, some strong emotional moments with one near the end can definitely tug at the heartstrings. However, the movie does suffer from some poor execution of certain elements. There is the Barbieland stuff which is enjoyable but the real-world stuff is just not that fun. It is stated early on that Barbie\'s thoughts are being influenced by someone playing with Barbies in the real world. How does the connection work? how much of Barbie\'s thought is her own? None of these things are explored, leaving many questions. On that note, certain characters will change very quickly without much build-up to these changes. Due to this, we don\'t get a true understanding of Barbie as a character, she changes because the film needs some kind of character development. There is also a mother and daughter character in the real world who Barbie meets. One of them is depressed and there is a rift between them but the film doesn\'t bother to explore the reason for any of that. We also meet Will Ferrell who plays the CEO of Mattel and he is just inconsequential to the story but takes a lot of screen time. He is also over-the-top and silly. I was hoping for a contrast between the cartoony Barbieland and the real world. However, characters in the real world act just as cartoony and ridiculous as those in Barbie Land. It makes the real-world scenes less impactful when it should have been a big moment in the film. The film is also incredibly preachy about its feminist message that it can be exhausting. Also, the 3rd act has a silly resolution that feels contradictory to the feminist nature of this film. Additionally, every male character in this film are idiotic baby and if that gets under your skin, then this movie is not for you. Overall, Barbie is a good fun time. I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed it. This film is not going to appeal to everyone with its themes and message. Nevertheless, the movie is just plain entertaining and honestly, it is ""Kenough"" for me!')}"
Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One,"Jul 12, 2023",2 h 43 m,81,8.2,"{('4', 'Nonsensical, illogical, boring, intelligence insulting garbage of a movie.'), ('6', 'This movie was decent, it lacked emotion in some scenes, it can best be described as a stereotypical heist film. The only reason my review is this good is because the cinematography was pretty polished and it had some half-decent (albeit excessive) use of suspense.'), ('8', ""Ok, I'm glad there are bangers like these being made, MIDR P1 is exceptionally well-paced, well-filmed, and just a blast to watch. In my opinion, though, it may be a little step behind Fallout, which is my favourite recent MI movie. Seriously, damn this film hits, now granted there are a few problems, some may notice that there are silent action scenes in here, and while I would prefer the music to represent what's going on in the film, they chose to keep some scenes completely silent of music for extended periods. What is interesting is that even when there are potential flaws in this film, my eyes are glued to the screen and the true reason why I'm giving it an 8/10 is because, well it is the first part of two films and the music score isn't as powerful as it was in Fallout. But anyway, The big question is, should you watch this? It is a definite YES, but watch it as late as you can so you don't have to wait so long for Part 2.

Alas, at least in my heart, Christopher McQuarrie\'s third crack at the ""Mission Impossible"" franchise is a total win for me, featuring some all-too-relevant thematics regarding the dangers of an ever-changing technopolitical landscape, as well as all the ""S"" tier action you\'ve come to expect from this filmmaker\'s take on this legendary IP. This has also gotta be one of the best ""part one"" films I think I\'ve ever seen. The narrative here, while an undeniable piece of a larger story, doesn\'t leave the audience feeling unrequited. To be sure, you\'ll definitely be left wanting more by the time the credits roll, but it\'s nowhere near as frustrating as — say— the endings of ""Avengers: Infinity War"" or ""Fast X."" In any event, I\'m really hoping the recent comments from McQuarrie are true and that we may be in store for more of these after ""Part Two.""

The story starts off well but then, as others have pointed out, becomes too focussed on 'the key.' 'The key this,' 'the key that.' I though this was going to be a segment.

The plot is generic and predictable, the characters are flat and uninteresting and the movie relies on action sequences instead of story. Mostly I was bored. I didn’t care if any of the characters died because they were cardboard and nothing about the story inspired me to care about them. While it was refreshing to watch a movie that wasn’t brimming with woke propaganda, it was still poorly written and boring. There is more wrong with modern “entertainment” than propaganda; the writing is the main issue.

I say that because I don\'t hesitate to walk out of movie if I\'m not into it but this one never gave me a window to walk out. I was invested in the story, even if it was a long boring story. It felt like a Tarantino movie but without the violent climax. The only time I felt like walking out is when Brendan Fraser shows up. He and the actor who plays the prosecutor are a huge contrast to De Niro\'s acting. Sorry, but it\'s true. They show up late in the movie and change the whole atmosphere to a Netflixy vibe. By that point I was like ""alright, I\'m done"". But I stayed. Also, halfway through it seems that DiCaprio starts playing a different character. I understood what the movie was supposed to be about in the last 10 minutes or so. It\'s supposed to be about human character and the lows that we can go to that may just be too low. But it doesn\'t do that well. It doesn\'t focus on the angst and the distress of the characters: just showing coffins and corpses is not doing that. That scene in the end is the one scene that feels close to it. But that scene alone doesn\'t pay off, even though it ties the movie together. I would say it\'s a good movie, I guess. It\'s worth watching simply because it\'s Scorcese and DiCaprio and De Niro. Really. It\'s also filled with some political stuff that feels a little forced in. Like they\'re trying to force an angle. I don\'t think you\'ll hate it if you watch it. You won\'t miss out on much if you don\'t.'), ('5', 'It’s alright. Performances from Lily, Leo, and De Niro were great but the movie as a whole is only mid. Screenplay is not good enough to justify that run time at all. Plot is paper thin, easily understandable, and there’s no mystery, twists, or tension to keep you engaged so it feels like a slog. Film is also from the white mans perspective instead of the Osage perspective. Lily is sidelined for too much of the film, when she is our only window into the Osage perspective to this whole event. Ending is very weak and abrupt, as if they were trying to shorten the run time a bit.

Definitely one of Scorsese's best recent films which is quite a feat itself!""), ('9', 'Scorsese is back with another cinematic masterpiece in one of 2023’s most anticipated movies, Killers of the Flower Moon. Based on the real life events in the Osage Nation during the 1920s. A heinous moment in American history is difficult to fit into one movie but here it is. All 3 hours and 26 minutes of it. So maybe not the movie to buy a bucket of coke for, that’s all I’m saying. Killers of the Flower Moon will have you captivated throughout. Some of you, myself included may not have been aware of some of the crimes committed during this point in history and it’s a truly shocking movie that will stay with you long after the credits have ended. When the Osage Nation discovered their land was full of oil they immediately became the richest people in the world. This sudden wealth attracted the worst kind of people whose greed led to the murder of these Native Americans over the course of years. It’s impossible for one movie to capture the horrendous nature of these murders and the sheer amount of people involved and Killers of the Flower Moon focuses on Mollie Kyle (Lily Gladstone) and Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio). Ernest returns home from the war to live with his uncle William “King” Hale (Robert De Niro) who assures him there’s real money to be made in Osage country. He soon realises how many white men have married Osage women for their wealth, all while the Osage people continue to be murdered one by one. Eventually the FBI step in to “see about these murders,” enter Jesse Plemons as Tom White. As if it wasn’t bad enough that the FBI took far too long to start investigating endless murders but the very sinister way these men integrated themselves into the Native American’s lives and picked them off one by one in horrific ways will turn your stomach. Although based on real events and the book of the same name, Killers of the Flower Moon condenses some of the events for the sake of storytelling. And there are certain facts that are omitted from this film. If you’re really interested it’s definitely worth reading up on the Osage murders after seeing the film. They’re even more horrific than you can imagine. You’re instantly plunged into this story after countless murders with no investigation and then forewarned to “find the wolves in this picture.” It’s a slow burner that builds the tension gradually with a soundtrack that feels like a heartbeat running throughout the whole film. As the relationship between Mollie and Ernest develops, the true nature of what’s happening in Osage country is revealed and the sense of dread and doom builds. Killers of the Flower Moon is a masterclass in storytelling and I’d expect nothing less from Martin Scorsese. A true crime epic Western that film fanatics need to see on the big screen. Leonardo DiCaprio puts in another great performance and De Niro plays William Hale to perfection. There are some divisive opinions forming on Killers of the Flower Moon, but if there’s one thing I think most of us can agree on is Lily Gladstone’s performance as Mollie Kyle. She is simply exceptional and the true heart of the film. Scorsese has also gathered an impressive supporting cast, Jesse Plemons being another standout performance. Scorsese is still making amazing movies, and Killers of the Flower Moon is another terrific film to add to the collection. For anyone wondering about the runtime, which has dominated most of the headlines, the reality is yes it will be too long for some people. You could definitely hear a pin drop at the screening I went to, but upon leaving the cinema I overheard some guy say “it had too many scenes.” Right fair enough we’re all entitled to our opinions but sure who am I to argue against Martin Scorsese. Yes it’s a long film but honestly I wouldn’t have taken out a single minute. So if you can’t sit still for nearly four hours then you can wait for the streaming date. For everyone else and particularly Scorsese fans, you all need to see this one. Killers of the Flower Moon is highly recommended. It’s one of the standout movies of the year and is clearly going to generate lots of awards buzz and if Lily Gladstone doesn’t win Best Actress I’ll be shocked. She is without a doubt one of the best performances I’ve seen all year.'), ('8', ""I enjoyed my time in the movie house watching it with a friend and it has a really nice story and good performance and some good body injuries once in a while.

I have heard nothing about it because I wanted to be interested because I liked the director and I certainly got what I wanted.

Scorsese is a one of kind filmmaker, and even now in the twilight of his artistic life, he crafts some of the most gripping and profoundly moving pieces of cinema. The way this harrowing story is told diverges from that of the book it most heavily draws from; rather than presenting a mystery that must be solved, the film confirms outright the perpetrators of the heinous acts we are about to witness. While this sounds on the surface like it might detract from the story, I think it reinforces the core message of the film: that crimes of this nature - at this time in America, saw no *true* justice for the victims. In the words of Malcom X, ""If someone is stabbed and the blade is simply removed, that isn\'t justice. Justice is when efforts are made and steps are taken to heal the wound that was left behind."" This is a story of betrayal and broken trust. It\'s about wounds that were never allowed to truly heal. Noteworthy are the performances, which are across the board absolute knockouts.

Along comes an eager youngish man (Leonardo DiCaprio) to work for his benevolent, powerful uncle (Robert De Niro).

A series of murders makes this basically a whodunit with Scorsese's directorial elevation. DiCaprio gives one of his strongest, most nuanced performances, De Niro holds sway with his intensity and Gladstone quietly portrays stoic strength. Scorsese's skills at creating compelling situations is in full force, although the much-discussed length will be a hindrance for some. Even at almost 3.5 hours, it never drags, but some editing wouldn't have hurt the story's thrust.

Creed III,"Mar 3, 2023",1 h 56 m,73,6.7,"{('7', ""This was yet another excellent chapter in the Rocky/Creed series, however it's also one of the most aesthetically unique. As this is Michael B. Jordan's first film as a director, I think he is still figuring things out and doesn't quite get the look he was trying for. Also, the movie suffers a little bit to transition between acts; it always feels a little abrupt. Having said that, the rest of the film is effective. The main plus is the antagonist; Jonathan Majors portrays one of the rocky/creed series' most nuanced and engaging antagonists. Outside of him, the battle sequences are superb, the character development is outstanding, and the training montages are strong. Where Michael B. Jordan's style really shines are the combat sequences.""), ('7', ""I love the Rocky franchise. It has its lows and its over-the-top entries but for the most part, this series has been mostly hits than misses. Creed was a spinoff and I never expected to enjoy it so immensely. I loved Creed 1 and Creed 2 which is why I was hoping for a hat trick with Creed 3. There was some worry as this is the first entry without Rocky. it was also Michael B. Jordan's directorial debut with him starring as Creed and directing. So does it succeed or is this a miss? Firstly, Michael did a great job in his directorial debut. He pushes the Creed movies out of Rocky's shadow and gives it more grit. The fights feel more visceral and flashy with some clear anime-inspired influence. He uses a lot of slow-mo which leads to some nice-looking shots. I also think the boxing intro and montage were also really well shot as well. He also does something interesting in the final fight that involves silence which gave it a new feel. The soundtrack was awesome and the cinematography is great. He also gives darker qualities to the story with the backstory and personal connection with the antagonist Damian (Jonathan Majors). On that note, Jonathan Majors is terrific as the antagonist. I love his performance, with the subtle awkwardness and slightly pained expression in the first half. Then in the second half, we get to see Jonathan give an arrogant, menacing performance when he goes full bad guy. I also enjoyed how sympathetic he is as a character as well. You understand why Adonis would help him. Additionally, Michael continues to give a great performance as Adonis Creed with the amount of emotional moments in this film. There is great chemistry between Michael and Jonathan which made the friendship between their characters feel believable. Tessa returns as Bianca and she is good in her small role in this film as well. However, I do have some issues with this film. The first half focuses on building up the characters and eventual conflict which is fine. The second half is incredibly rushed though with clearly many cuts made towards it. We don't get a great sense of how much time passed so it is baffling to suddenly see Damian successful so quickly. It would've helped to have seen Damian in more fights. We could have seen him growing more and more successful while also seeing how much of a threat he is. Unfortunately, this movie doesn't have a lot of boxing fights and enough build-up in the second half. It is also weird how quickly Damian's personality changes. Another issue is the lack of inner conflict for Adonis. We see him feeling guilty about what happened to Damian but that's mostly it. For example, we don't see his doubt about retiring or concern about his daughter and wife. On that note, there is a daughter subplot introduced in this film that went nowhere. Felt very pointless. Overall, Creed III is another good entry in this franchise. It's an impressive directorial debut from Michael and I look forward to future work from him, Creed or otherwise. Even without Rocky, this franchise seems to be doing well standing on its own feet. I'm not sure what direction Creed 4 can go in but if it is of a similar quality to previous entries, then I will 100% be there to watch!""), ('8', ""As a Rocky fan who didn't really love Creed II, I thought Creed III was the true sequel to the first Creed (which I hold in high regard and the best Rocky film besides the first). Similar narrative themes can be found from writer Ryan Coogler's other films like Creed, Black Panther, and Fruitvale Station but Creed III's unique identity definitely comes from new-director Michael B. Jordan, who infuses his own sensibilities and tastes into every scene. Especially the fight sequences. The film's core story felt similar to Rocky V but done in the right way; solid performances, great cinematography, well-paced editing, and clear directionality to the narrative. The film charts into more familiar and predictable territory near the half way marker where character, unfortunately, take a turn into cliche stereotypes and lose a bit of humanity. Emotional clarity is lost during training montages and what's at stake is a little muddled. Fortunately, it does end off on a high note with a satisfactory conclusion. I truly did feel like the absence of Sylvester Stalone's Rocky was not only missed, but could've been narratively powerful, sending the film soaring.

I also really enjoyed the music quite a bit, even though I don’t really listen to rap. All the orchestral and rap music fit the scenes and vibe of the film. And the boxing scenes may be some of the best looking yet. Like in every Rocky and Creed film, they try new cinematography ideas for the boxing scenes; they were pretty interesting. There were a few scenes I thought were a bit off, but nothing egregious. I did like the antagonist (though I wish they did a better job explaining his specific crime and length of time in prison) as it is one that feels multidimensional and has motivations that are understandable.

I used to love Baskin Robbins when I was a little girl. ha ha The reference and Scott-employee cameo were cute.

The movie’s marketing made it feel like the film was going to lean heavier into the horror aspect rather than the family (which the book focuses on), but strangely censors itself to avoid gore or anything that would leave the viewer uneasy. Overall, the film felt rushed, and the decisions felt forced. Not much left for discussion which was a strong point of the book.

Instead, ""in the cinematographic imagination, as in the common one, the word \'apocalypse\' evokes more destruction than healing, more catastrophe than salvation, so that the latter assumes, for the most part, the aspect of pure escape.

The first 50 minutes of the film is *very* loaded with dialogue (not exactly this series\' strong suit) and the latter half of the film is *very* loaded with action.

I was steadfast against it because of the writers saying the quiet part out loud about purposely emasculating men. Spoiler alert: they weren\'t kidding (except for a nicely portrayed old school Paladin). But, being a parent of a teen, he was quite keen to see this movie, and we have strongly bonded over both baseball and old school AD&D, so off to the theater we went (matinee prices). I played AD&D in the 80s, during the height of the ""zomg satanic"" scares. My friends and I were, above all, nerds. Stranger Things portrayed that aspect of us quite well, minus the parallel world and telekinetic teen. It\'s been a joy to play AD&D as DM for my children and friends, although we are strictly a 1e, not 5e world. I\'m sort of pleased to see so many people trying to retrofit to 1e from 5e in light of latest drama. However, having said that, I still recognized that this movie was going to try to cater/nod its way towards 5e players. The inclusion of things like the Dragonborn and bird people(?) races confirmed that for me. To the critiques: Even APART from ""most tabletop adventures at home will be better than what the writers can come up with"" criticism (which I find quite valid), we shouldn\'t forget that Gary Gygax et al created just EPIC adventures in module form. Tomb of Horrors, the Against the Giants series, even The Temple of Elemental Evil are all rousing adventures that are just sort of . . . out there for inspiration. My son pointed out that adventures like that almost might be better for a streaming service, in a serial form. That would also allow for far more character development/arcs. More nitpicky: I guess that while I enjoyed the movie, I also had quite a few problems with the writers not taking a few simple extra steps for either fan service, or just . . . making the movie MORE like D&D. For instance, Capt. Kirk certainly is portrayed to be a Bard. The old Bard started off as a fighter, abandons that class to become a thief, and then after sufficient time becomes a Bard, whereupon the character can employ abilities from the two abandoned classes. Capt. Kirk is shown, early in the movie, to be a fighter (armored, with a sword), later gives that up to become a thief, and then wields a lute, but there\'s no mention as to why that\'s important. IS he even a Bard, or do they just go to efforts to make it look that way, and then ""lol nope?"" Even a throwaway line might have helped, much less him using his OWN lute to cast an illusion at a later point in the movie (I won\'t be specific since it\'s just out). Also, what was with the ""wheel of spells"" thing on the belt of the Magic User? Not a line about how he got it, what it even is, or why he is inept at selecting spells? Is it a random thing, like the Deck of Many Things, or a Wand of Wonder? There is a single mention of the word ""Cleric"" in the movie -- those are typically healers. With a bit more knowledge, the writers could have allowed the Magic User to say, at a CERTAIN point in the movie (""I can\'t help [person]. I\'m not a cleric.""). Something like that, at least. Finally, they went to a hell of a lot of trouble to obtain the helm -- did anyone see what became of it by the end of the movie? Is this a Shazam 2 thing, where in the next movie someone is going to find it in a museum? Despite all these criticisms overall the movie was certainly . . . mid. Worth the matinee price at least.

The story starts with the bard Edgin and female barbarian Holga in a prison. They hope to be pardoned and telling the story how they got into trouble. However this is just the set up as they did not know that there was more behind it. The story fully works. All characters have their flaws, motivations and heroes journey. More movies need to do this. I liked them because I can relate to their struggles. Everyone has doubts, made decisions that backfire or dis-improves things by trying to fix them. There are also tons of lore, easter eggs and references. If you pay attention you even see the characters from the old D&D cartoon. The cast is near perfect and fits their roles. Chris Pine, Michelle Rodrigues, Sophia Lillis, Rege Jean Page, Justine Smith and all the others are excellent and have great chemistry. The bad guys are so enjoyable. I love to hate them. I should also praise the writers and directors. They made an awesome movie. Other than that I praise the humor and action scenes. Both are fully satisfying. The special effects are great too. They fit into the movie in a way that feels genuine. Overall I think I should give a 10/10. It might not be that good but it is a positive surprise and immense improvement.

Don’t get me wrong - The actors did a good job given a plot that somewhat just falls apart towards the end. It’s a standard plot with plenty of foreshadowing, peaks and valleys, and a climax, but it just felt a bit like too many producers got involved in making sure the last 20 minutes or so were epic and memorable. They were visually appealing and I love sci-fi, so this is getting a solid 7/10 in my book, but something just felt a bit off once I had counted at least 3 to 4 plot holes in the development of this the ethics of sentient AI vs. “let’s all good along” message being too easily and repeatedly shoved down the audience’s throat. Go see it, if for nothing else, the gargantuan scale of some of the war machines. I would love to see a sequel that goes further down the road of something more similar to Blade Runner or even the Cyberpunk 2077 game and its Night City setting.'), ('8', ""In general, it's an excellent sci-fi movie but would have been way more enjoyable if the characters had more depth, and I would say the 1st 30 minutes is a skip-forward moment. As the meat of the movie is 30 minutes in. They should have explored way more about the robots and how they became life-like and had to flee to Asia. I also find it strange that AI robots who are weak and feeble when they should have built upon their superior speed and ability to work together were lost in this film. It also seemed very weird with all the great tech they had and the cities they built and lived in that the humans could wipe them out. This part seemed far-fetched and a reach.

But this film reaches a new low. Not only do these flash scenes follow one another like so many social media reels, but the inconsistencies and absurdities also pile up at a breakneck pace. Characters teleport, appear for no reason, die and then show up in the next scene; a garden is placed in a space military base, and an army of AI robots exists in an army that supposedly hates AI robots.

Perhaps because the theme of the film is also a topic of today's world. The wars of today may not have been caused by AI, but the parallels can certainly be made.

The robots are basically the same. very little range overall in this very strange world the movie tries to present. literally nothing makes sense. It tries to present world events and war as understood by a 3 yr old child. it amounts to ""good/bad because I told you it is"" with no nuance or development. it\'s got to be one of the poorest written movies I\'ve seen in a while and I went to the cinema for this...

Unfortunately the operation here is disappointing, uninteresting and not very engaging. The film, despite being a horror film, scares little, and never feels truly disturbing/tensive. Apart from the make-up and the general rendering of the possession, as well as the atmosphere of unease that reigns in the first part of the film, the work as a whole, however, appears weak and non-incisive, above all due to a shoddy production and a superficial screenplay, which oscillates between uncertainties and excesses, spoils the beautiful premises, and also neglects some interesting thematic/reflective ideas.

They disappear for three days, scaring the living daylights out of their families but while their return should have been a relief, it turns out the horrors are only beginning. Not only do the girls have no memory of what happened to them but they also appear to be showing the tell-tale signs of possession. Growly voices, check. Creepy eyes, check. Lewd comments and unexplained scars, check and check. This is more than enough to call in the expert and who better to call than someone who’s experienced these horrors before, 50 years ago.

If it was scary or entertaining I could get over that but unfortunately horror fans will be neither scared nor entertained. There are a couple of things that happen in this movie that I can’t mention for spoiler reasons, but I felt the disrespect to the original and the characters so I can’t see that going down well, especially with all The Exorcist fans. Most cinemas re-released the original Exorcist for the 50th anniversary so for anyone in the mood for this kind of horror movie you’d be better off with that instead. You’re in safe hands with William Friedkin, I can’t say the same for David Gordon Green, who gave us such films like Halloween 2018, Halloween Kills and Halloween Ends. It’s hard to believe this is considered a financial success, especially seeing the completely empty screen I was in and we’re pretty much guaranteed more Exorcist movies. Don’t everyone cheer at once. Whereas I wouldn’t be remotely excited for another movie in this franchise I would see another movie in The Pope’s Exorcist franchise for one reason. That film, although completely ridiculous was entertaining. This on the other hand, despite a promising start was bland, formulaic and not scary. No exorcism movie has ever come close to the original Exorcist and die-hard fans of that movie will not be impressed by this new one. But then again the bar was very high.

Now after a significantly smaller gap of just 1 year, we have another instalment in the Scream franchise. Does it continue to be a slashing entry or is this going to be the first to fall flat on its face? Firstly, I love the change in setting for this film. Bringing the franchise out of Woodsboro made this a more interesting entry. We get to see Ghostface kill in the city and that leads to a lot of interesting set pieces. A memorable one was Ghostface hiding amongst other Halloween people on a subway. These scenes are incredibly tense and suspenseful. I also love how brutal this new Ghostface is. The way they stab their victims, hunt the main characters and hurt anyone in their way is unsettling. The opening scene was also a terrific way of subverting expectations. The mystery surrounding the new Ghostface is engaging and effective in its execution. Neve Campbell does not return as Sidney for the first time in the series due to a pay dispute which is a shame. However, I think the way her character is handled is done respectfully. Her absence leads to a focus on the characters from Scream V and it makes the film a lot better. On that note, Melissa and Jenna return as Sam and Tara respectively from Scream V and I liked them more here. I liked how both characters handled the traumatic events in that film. Sam is very cautious and protective of her sister since the event but Tara just wants to move on. I especially enjoyed Sam's struggle with her inner darkness which was hinted at in the previous film. The surviving supporting cast from Scream V also has more depth this time with their friendship with Sam and Tara being more meaningful. Courteney Cox returns as Gale and despite being a small role, she has an enjoyable and tense scene with Ghostface. The biggest surprise was Hayden Panettiere returning as Kirby from Scream 4. The last we saw of her was her getting stabbed and bleeding out so it was a surprise to see her alive. I enjoyed seeing how she also changed since Scream 4. She is more hardened and resolved but unlike with Sidney, it's hard to tell if it is truly genuine or if she is Ghostface. Nevertheless, I do have some issues with it. My biggest is characters surviving fatal wounds. Some characters would get stabbed in the gut and leg but still have loads of energy to fight with no issues. You could argue that it is Adrenaline but it is kind of weird. Some characters survive getting stabbed dozens of times which is just plain ridiculous. It felt like they were scared to kill off characters. The story also relies on plot conveniences and incompetent cops. The Ghostface is hunting our main characters and none of the police think to stay with them. Once it is revealed who is Ghostface, their plan feels a bit ridiculous and also feels like it could have easily been uncovered if anyone from the police or FBI weren't dumb. Overall, Scream continues to deliver refreshing movies in the slasher genre. 6 movies in and there isn't a terrible movie in the franchise. I hope whatever future entry this franchise has, that continues to do something new and exciting.""), ('1', ""To be Clear, the only Ghost Face is Courteney Cox, easily the scariest part of this film.

We have women wearing ""I\'m a strong woman"" T-shirts as well as trans people walking the streets in the background. Almost every character is of colour except all the bad guys, who are predictably, white. On a separate note, Courtney Cox\'s top lip looks about as stiff as the corpses being left behind by the killer. Monika from friends now looks like that recent picture of Madonna, where she looks like the Jigsaw Killer from \'Saw.\' Accordingly, I now call her \'Madonika.\' Coming up with that name was the best part of this film. Unsurprisingly, she is also dating someone black, meaning that not one same-race couple exists in this film, as though it doesn\'t exist in real life.

Why have there been so many pointless and bad sequels to one great film? I have to say though that the editing was excellent, some of the best editing in a film for a long time. There is like 15 minutes of exposition explaining who did what and why but that is so boring. Surely they could have explained it better? Anyway, another wasted potential and waste of time aside.

Mario is arguably one of the best video games franchises ever as its formulas just work well, however it has a big flaw: not being able to flesh out things surrounding the narrative such as plot and characters. Will the movie be able to change that since these are crucial aspects for a movie? The answer is no, as \'The Super Mario Bros Movie\' is completely afraid to take any risk. The plot is as predictable and basic as it can get with many sub-plots that either get pushed aside or are straight-up ignored. The ridiculously fast pacing also doesn\'t allow you to enjoy each scene to the fullest and makes the plot even more messy than it already is. The voice acting went full mainstream (and with mainstream I mean boring). The iconic Charles Martinet, despite being available, does not reprise his role as Mario and Luigi but is voicing a side character instead. Chris Pratt as Mario sounds as grating as you\'d expect and Bowser aside, all characters sound almost as off as he does. Why is this movie so beloved then? Why is it so high when it fails on almost everything? Simple, because it\'s Mario so you HAVE to like it, but if it wasn\'t for Mario this movie would never be as big as it is.

No new fresh or creative ideas here as far as the financial dramedy subgenre is concerned, and despite a stellar cast and an especially notable lead performance from the always reliable and supremely underrated Paul Dano, the film simply falls flat by the end and comes out as neither entertaining nor unique in any way and is simply rather forgettable.""), ('8', 'Enjoyed this.

It's a movie after all, not a forensic accounting explanation. In this regard, it meets my expectations. The movie is nothing extraordinary, but credit must be given to what is well done.""), ('8', 'IN A NUTSHELL: Dumb Money is the ultimate David vs. Goliath tale, based on the insane, true story of everyday people who flipped the script on Wall Street and got rich by turning GameStop (the video game company) into the world’s hottest company for a time during the pandemic.

THINGS I LIKED: The lineup of actors is fantastic and includes Paul Dano, Pete Davidson, Vincent D’Onofrio, America Ferrera, Nick Offerman, Anthony Ramos, Seth Rogen, Talia Ryder, Sebastian Stan, Shailene Woodley, Myha’la Herrold, Clancy Brown, and so many more. They created quirky, fun characters, and all did an outstanding job. Remember the Winklevoss twins in the movie The Social Network? They’re two of the executive producers for this movie. They got into a legal battle with Mark Zuckerberg, which was written about in the book “The Accidental Billionaires” written by Ben Mezrich. Ben Mezrich also wrote the book “The Antisocial Network”, which is what inspired this movie. I thought it was funny that the waitress knew about stocks and investing. Who doesn’t love a good underdog movie, especially when people who are struggling in the economy can stick it to the “Man”? The movie does a great job illustrating the nuances of living in a pandemic. Even if you don’t completely understand the investment world, you’ll still enjoy the story that shows the “little guy” beating out supposedly smarter Wall Street experts. Thanks to a real-life video clip by Steven Colbert, the film explains what a short sale or short squeeze is. There is a lot of spoken and visual humor. We get to see video clips of the real people involved in these events at the end of the movie THINGS I DIDN’T LIKE: The real Ken Griffin is entrenched in a lawsuit over how his character has been portrayed by Nick Offerman in the film. There are so many characters to try to keep track of. Some viewers have complained that this movie has come out too soon. Do you agree? I spent a lot of money buying video games for my 4 sons over the years. Too bad I didn’t invest during this unprecedented rise! Boomers might be annoyed by all of the raunchy Millennials. TIPS FOR PARENTS: Kids will be completely bored hearing about stocks. More importantly, the dialogue and the lyrics to the soundtrack are filthy and profane. We also see a lot of crude images and gestures. SO many F-bombs. A young kid flips the bird. Lesbians are shown kissing and saying crude things. Some Spanish is spoken with subtitles.

Feels like a rushed movie that didn't take the time to make a rounded film with direction from start to finish.""), ('7', 'In 2021, YouTuber Keith Gill (Paul Dano) singled out GameStop as his favorite undervalued stock. This took off among individual investors and grew dramatically, which caused a bit of a panic with some institutional firms. There was potential for this to be a satirical expose like The Big Short (my review), but they chose to play it straight. As a result, we get a rather dry, by-the-numbers examination of how if affected several regular people, as well as some of the billionaire investors. This constant back and forth keeps the pace moving, but prevents any depth in the characters or situations. The aggressive soundtrack also keeps things lively. Even without any emotional connection, this film remains a fascinating examination of ""little guy"" personal investors taking on the Wall Street machine.')}"

This doesn't start the same way, this starts like a horror story waiting to be debunked or explained. And then of course, the story adds more layers and more mystery. Great characters here, great acting, all done very seriously and very well. The pacing was rather good here too.

Unfortunately, the mystery itself is somewhat predictable and unbelievable, so come to this film for the goosebumps rather than the big reveal.'), ('7', '[Branagh] is not a director of tasteful restraint, and bless him for that. A Haunting in Venice is a movie that wants you to gasp with delight at each and every shot.'), ('4', ""Kenneth Branagh is back as Hercule Poirot and as director of the latest Agatha Christie mystery. This one's set in post-war Venice, when an admiring writer (Tina Fey in a slightly-sassy period-perfect turn) escorts him to a Halloween séance that ends in murder. The big difference in this movie is the darkness. Whereas the other recent films in the series featured elegant settings, this one is set almost entirely in a run-down palazzo, with very little lighting. This is motivated by the spooky elements that border on supernatural. While the cinematography by Haris Zambarloukos is stylish, Branagh relies too often of sudden crashes for scares. The merging of two genres doesn't make the suspense or mystery any stronger, but the film is OK as a mildly interesting whodunit.""), ('6', ""Kenneth Branagh returns to direct for the third time in the role of Hercules Poirot in an unusual gothic chamber mystery, this time only loosely inspired by “Hallowe'en Party”, Agatha Christie's 1969 novel, and sets the new mystery-crime no longer in the English countryside but in a foggy Venice after the Second World War, constantly surrounded by dark and disturbing atmospheres. The director-actor decides to distance himself greatly from the original text while keeping the crucial points fixed; to rewrite Agatha Christie's Poirot in a personal key; to renew the style, tones and register adopted by previous films; and to veer towards the horror-tinged thriller, introducing a supernatural dimension that puts (in crisis) the investigator's logical-rational thinking and skepticism when faced with the spiritual sphere, death and faith in the afterlife. This time the real investigative investigation therefore seems to be the one to be carried out in the mind of the protagonist, in his fears and fragility, especially in the face of esoteric/occult events to which he is unable to give a logical explanation, even before that which takes place regarding the case to be solved. Rhythm, atmosphere, twists and tension make this latest film enjoyable, but not fully successful. Michael Green's script sometimes seems mechanical and fails to blend the thriller genre with the horror one well; the cast remains on the sidelines; the characters are rather sketchy and stereotyped; the topic (as well as the entire investigation) appears not very in-depth and attractive; and the dramatic potential of some sequences as well as Christie's caustic humor are not exploited or expressed properly. Even many details of the entire formal apparatus at times seem emptied of their strength and in the end reveal fluctuating results in terms of effectiveness. But overall the work manages to entertain the spectator who, without many pretensions, is (well) disposed to watching it. Despite alternating between strengths and weaknesses, the film still works in its entirety: the positive aspect is that it is quite accurate, fluid and intriguing; the staging with an eye towards new experimental perspectives; an aesthetic (see the excellent direction, scenography and photography) with suggestive effects in favoring a sense of anguish, bewilderment and destabilization for the protagonist and the audience. These aspects which, albeit with difficulty, at least manage to compensate for the limits and imperfections of the film, and that is in particular the many narrative and visual solutions which are a little more banal, predictable and vacuous, less elaborate or interesting and above all less evocative than to the previous chapters.

I did enjoy the film. Especially from a directorial standpoint, the film boasts exquisite scenes.""), ('9', 'IN A NUTSHELL: I love Sir Kenneth Branagh both in front of a behind the camera. He directs the movie, as well as stars in it, featuring that multi-layered mustache. He also wears the hat of a producer, along with Ridley Scott, Judy Hofflund, and Simon Kinberg. Supposedly, the movie is based on the novel “Hallowe’en Party” by Dame Agatha Christie published in 1969. While the whodunnit book takes place in England, the movie’s location is Venice, Italy. Surprisingly, this is the very first time a movie adaptation has been made about the book! THINGS I LIKED: The cast is fantastic and includes Sir Kenneth Branagh, Tina Fey, Camille Cottin, Riccardo Scamarcio, Kelly Reilly, Jude Hill, Jamie Dornan, Rowan Robinson, Michelle Yeoh, Emma Laird, Kyle Allen, and Ali Khan. Everyone does an excellent job. Perfectly timed for the Halloween season in the USA, the movie offers an extremely creepy setting with plenty of jumps and scares. I got to see this in the theater on opening night. While walking down the hallways in the large theater, I saw a TON of movie posters for creepy movies coming out in time for Halloween. One thing I really liked about this film is that it doesn’t have all of the violence, blood, and gore of some of the upcoming scary movies. In order to get genuine scares out of the actors, the director worked with the technical department to cause things to happen without their knowing beforehand. Actor Kelly Reilly admitted that all of the scary moments in the seance scene scared the “bejesus” out of her. We get to see some absolutely gorgeous images of Venice. I’ve been there twice and love its look and feel. It’s such a unique location, allowing for the cinematographer, Haris Zambarloukos, to make perfect postcard shots. The bird’s-eye view of the entire city at the end of the movie is stunning, and the palazzo’s interior makes for the perfect haunted house. Despite its very dark setting and story, there is still a lot of clever humor to be had. Each scene was so carefully crafted that you could see that much attention to detail was given by the director. I always admire that in a director .A clever element of this dark addition to the Hercule Poirot franchise is that he is very much rattled by what he experiences. He second-guesses himself and is faced with questions about God, Satan, and the afterlife. The clues are there but it’s easy to miss them when so many other things are happening around the characters. I didn’t figure out who the murderer was at all. I love how Hercule Poirot is able to catch the little details in order to solve the crime. The movie poster is unsettling. THINGS I DIDN’T LIKE: If you’re a fan of Agatha Christie’s book, you might be a little disappointed because the film only loosely follows that story. In good news, many viewers are saying the movie is actually better than the book! Many scenes are visually dark, so try to watch this on the biggest screen you can. I like Tina Fey in comedy but wasn’t sure she was perfectly cast in this role. I wish I had been able to turn on subtitles in the theater. Some of the accents made it difficult to understand what everyone was saying. Act 3 wraps up very quickly and suddenly. TIPS FOR PARENTS: This will be way too scary for many kids, especially young ones. We see some dead bodies. There is some blood. We hear and see ghosts. A seance is held and many scary things happen.'), ('7', 'Am impossibly large visual upgrade over the previous 2 Branagh/Poirot films. The horror themes are light but work well in context of the story and setting. The whodunnit aspect is more straight forward and simpler than typical Christie work.'), ('9', 'Brilliant film that combines horror cliches, stereotypes, and dramatic effects with a profound commentary on trauma, memory, and denial of loss in the contemporary wasteland of decaying Venice. This is a deceptively deep movie and a memorable performance by Kenneth Branagh, which attacks illusions of mastery and redemption embodied in the character of Poirot with an unflinching look at our helplessness in face of the realities of history.'), ('5', ""Felt like I watched a game of Mafia where everyone took their roles way too seriously. Haunting lore wasn't explored too much even though it's core to the plot. Interesting to see the pieces fit together in the end, but felt a bit too contrived.""), ('8', 'Another mystery to solve, in the hands of Hercule Poirot; now in a dark turn. As a spectator, one feels enveloped by the intrigue and plays the role of detective to put together the puzzle, in the midst of surprises; The result is certainly, for those who like the genre, satisfactory.'), ('7', ""This was an interesting and unique tale. I really loved the combining of crime whodunit with a stellar true paranormal mystery! Something that I know Hercule was by no means prepared for but made this a great movie to watch nonetheless. I love the element of Agatha Christie in this and having Tina Fey play the role made it all the more amusing.

The story this time was really well done and I enjoyed the twists that it offered.

I don’t ever review movies but this deserves one because the meta rating is much lower than a film of this caliber should deserve. It will achieve cult status in the spooky season genre no doubt.

It’s a refreshing new perspective on the Haunted Mansion as its focus is shifted elsewhere (plot-wise); so while watching it I hardly thought about the original. There were some flaws, yes, and it could do without certain scenes but overall it was a movie I enjoyed and wouldn’t mind seeing it again.'), ('5', ""Haunted Mansion is Disney's second attempt at making a movie based on the titled ride. The 2003 version starring Eddie Murphy was critically not well received and flopped at the box office. However, it has a cult following nowadays and honestly, it's a decently fun movie. Does this second attempt deliver more or is it just another failed attempt at turning another ride into the next Pirates of the Caribbean? One of the biggest things you will get out of this film is how amazing Lakeith Stanfield is as the main lead. He delivers a standout performance with some genuinely strong emotional performance from him. This is thanks to how his character is written. It is surprising to see Disney have an adult character dealing with loss and still grieving from it. He is also an introverted character with anxiety issues which is not something you see a lot from main characters in big IPs. His character is the heart and most engaging element. His character development is a wonderful thing to watch. The exploration of grief is well-done and it's a meaningful theme to explore in a family film. The cast also all have decent chemistry. Owen Wilson just steals a lot of the scene with his charisma. Danny Devito is a bundle of joy as usual. Tiffany Haddish is good during the more serious and emotional stuff but her comedy is a mixed bag. Rosario Dawson is mostly serious but it works fine. It is at its most enjoyable when the cast is bouncing off each other. Jamie Lee Curtis has a minor role as Madame Leota but she does great with her small screen time. The first act started strong with some decent horror and tension. Some of the scares are pretty surprising for a movie that is also aimed at kids. There are also some great visual sequences. For example, the door opening to a sea or the hallways becoming longer or the pictures starting to move behind the character's back. Unfortunately, it becomes pretty bland after the initial strong start. The second and third act start ditching any of the horror energy and becomes an adventure movie. It becomes reliant on jump scares but none of them are really that effective. The plot is also very standard and forgettable. There isn't any interesting character development for other characters nor is there any great twist or revelations in the plot. It doesn't help that this movie tries to be a PG13 horror but also a comedy and is not good at either. There are so many silly jokes and dialogue that just don't land. It didn't even give me a chuckle. The movie is 2 hours and that is too long. There are many moments where the pacing is just slow or where scenes drag on longer than necessary or there is a pointless padding scene. 20 minutes could have been easily cut out of this film which would no doubt help the pacing. I'm also saddened by how reliant this movie is on CGI. A lot of the ghosts are CGI and the effects are CGI, all of which are very noticeable. It's a shame as most of these could have been done practically and look way better for it. It baffles me that the main antagonist is CGI. Could they not get Jared Leto in prosthetics or something? Also, there are so many noticeable product placements as well. There are so many dialogues where characters randomly mention products for no reason. For example, a character mentions getting a mansion from Zillow or getting stuff from Costco. The biggest offender was during a serious moment and the character mentions Baskin Robbins which took me out of the moment. Overall, Haunted Mansion 2023 is a decent second attempt. It's not amazing or that memorable and it's not better or worse than the 2003 version. It's an okay movie but I definitely expected better from a movie with Disney money. I do want to see what ride they adapt into a movie next, Expedition Everest perhaps?""), ('6', ""Before Disney went into an acquisition 'binge' with Pixar, Lucasfilm and Marvel, its live action division wasn't really doing that great. Mediocre, yet suprisingly high budgeted fare such as this was the norm. That's too bad because the cast was absolutelly stellar yet was given nothing to do. The audiences are more discerning these days and despite its production values, they knew a streaming movie when they see one.""), ('2', 'The Disney gravy train continues, and if it’s not another live action remake it’s a theme park ride adaptation. Well although these theme park movies have served them well in the past (5 Pirates of the Caribbean movies, Jungle Cruise etc.), they’ve now had a go at a spooky tale suitable for the whole family. Well that was the idea but unfortunately this new Haunted Mansion movie will be too scary for some young viewers and too boring for everyone else. Not even a strong cast made up of LaKeith Stanfield, Rosario Dawson, Owen Wilson, Tiffany Haddish, Danny DeVito, and Jamie Lee Curtis is enough to save this snooze-fest. A single mother, Gabbie (Rosario Dawson) moves into a lovely mansion that unfortunately is also home to a whole bunch of ghosts. Enter a tour guide (LaKeith Stanfield) a priest (Owen Wilson), a psychic (Tiffany Haddish) and a historian (Danny DeVito) to all get together and help exorcise the ghosts from the Haunted Mansion. An unlikely group of heroes forced together in a very unusual circumstance that should have resulted in a comedic spooky tale but ends up as a bland, boring story that I couldn’t wait to be finally over. This isn’t the worst film I’ve seen all year but it’s close. Haunted Mansion fails at a family comedy and fails as a spooky ghost story. It’s got a dull script that even a good cast can’t do anything with. The effects are horrendous, you’d see better looking ghosts in a PS2 game. It can’t fit comfortably into a genre because it’s not funny and not scary. This felt endless and I can’t believe it’s only two hours because it felt more like four. The idea was good and clearly there’s lots to work with from the theme park ride, as all these ghosts with different back stories keep showing up throughout the film. There’s certainly enough of them stuffed into it and perhaps it would have been better as a mini series to explore some of the different ghost tales and actually develop some characters instead of quickly jamming them altogether into the mansion as quick as possible with the 999 other ghosts before the really evil ghost completes his plan of collecting 1000 souls. Haunted Mansion moves from one haunted room to another, leaving you feeling like you’d rather be in the haunted mansion ride itself rather than this. Hell even those little crappy ghost trains we all got dragged to at some point as a child is better than this because it’s over quicker. I went in with low expectations and I was still disappointed. Haunted Mansion is a wasted opportunity because with that cast it should have been a hell of a lot better than the result. And it’s really not their fault, without a good script you don’t have a good movie and if Disney put an actual film maker in charge of things they might end up with better material because they’ve long since shown themselves to be completely out of ideas. Too bad they can’t understand the importance of good writers and yet another mediocre theme park based movie only serves as a further reminder that originality died at Disney years ago. We’re entering spooky season now and there are so many better things you could watch instead of this utter mess, Casper, The Nightmare Before Christmas, The Addams Family, Coraline, Beetlejuice and of course Hocus Pocus. Honestly there’s episodes of Scooby-Doo that are more entertaining than Haunted Mansion. But for anyone genuinely looking for a not too scary Halloween movie for the whole family, check out any of the above and skip this utter mess of a movie because there’s very few people I’d recommend this to. Haunted Mansion is recommended for die-hard fans of the theme park, I’m not saying you’ll all enjoy it but if this movie was made for anyone, it’s you guys. For everyone else, I’d say skip this one.'), ('7', 'I loved how they incorporated aspects from the original film into this one. Green screen visuals were a bit obvious at times but it had great character and LaKeith was an absolute standout!'), ('7', 'IN A NUTSHELL: Featuring the iconic attraction at Disneyland, this story is about a single mother and son who move into a house, only to discover it is haunted. They recruit the help of a tour guide, psychic, priest, and historian only to learn there is much more to the ghosts than anyone was prepared for. THINGS I LIKED: If you love the Haunted Mansion ride at Disneyland, you’ll love all of the scenes that honor the spirit of that fan favorite. So many Easter eggs to enjoy! The cast includes reliable fan favorites too: Jared Leto, Jamie Lee Curtis, Owen Wilson, Danny DeVito, Tiffany Haddish, LaKeith Stanfield, and Rosario Dawson. We’re also treated to the young Chase W. Dillon, who might be new to some viewers. They all do a great job. The special effects that make the ghosts look truly ghostly worked really well to resemble what we see in the famous ride at the theme park. The name of the mansion, Gracey Manor, is to honor Yale Gracey, a Disney Imagineer who originated the illusion of the ghosts flying around the dining room table in the theme park. Lots of humor with snarky dialogue and physical gags. The film does a great job showcasing the unique vibe of New Orleans. It’s very different from the 2003 film of the same name. The sound effects are terrific. You really hear all of the creaks you would expect in a haunted house. There is a lot of action, but it’s blended well with touching moments and heart. Each of the characters gets the spotlight at least once and experiences some growth. That’s impressive for an ensemble cast. THINGS I DIDN’T LIKE: It’s a bit too long. Some viewers are complaining the movie isn’t scary enough, but I disagree. Disneyland was originally created for families, so I don’t think the film should be too scary. Guillermo del Toro was originally involved and, if he had remained, I have no doubt this movie would have been scarier! Not all of the jokes land. A lot of the talented actors are underutilized. A lot of the action sequences are chaotic. Why wasn’t this movie released closer to Halloween?

The simplicity of the story is what makes it so good.'), ('7', 'Good storyline, characters and setting.'), ('6', 'One of the most overrated movies of the decade.'), ('10', 'Writer/Director Celine Song has used her own life story to craft 2023’s best film so far. Nora is twelve years old and has a crush on her classmate Hae Song. Unfortunately for the burgeoning romance, Nora’s parents have decided to leave Seoul and immigrate to Canada. Twelve years later, Nora and Hae Song reconnect through the miracle of social media. Their relationship becomes a series of video calls where the sense of connection is palpable. Eventually though, Nora decides that they should stop talking for a while; she wants to focus on career opportunities in her new home town of New York City. Another twelve years later, Hae Song decides to vacation in New York City. It’s an opportunity for him to see a now-married Nora face-to-face for the first time in twenty-four years. It’s all sweet, sad and thoughtful. In the process, this film offers more observations about the human condition than any film in recent memory. Several elements make this film outstanding. The cast is pitch perfect. As the adult Nora, Greta Lee (“The Morning Show,” “Russian Doll,” Will Aronson’s musical “My Scary Girl”) is mesmerizing. She blends her well-honed comic timing with a sincerity and vulnerability that are irresistible. As Hae Song, Teo Yoo (“Leto,” “Decision to Leave”) is equally impressive. You can often read his emotions without a word having to be spoken. John Magaro (“The Big Short,” “First Cow”) has a smaller but still essential role as Nora’s husband, Arthur. In one of the best film scenes in recent memory, Nora and Hae Song are in a bar speaking in animated Korean while Arthur sits patiently, uncomfortably beside her. Clearly, this is a film that could have gone in a million different directions. Song deftly uses her story to explore a variety of themes – the nature of relationships, the immigrant experience, the necessary balance between work and relationships, the role of fate (and the Korean concept of “in-yun”). She does it all in an unhurried style that makes “Past Lives” feel similar to Richard Linklater’s “Before” trilogy. It’s my guess this film will be equally well-loved and critically regarded. What’s most surprising here is Song’s self-confidence as a first-time filmmaker, given that she has the additional responsibility of being true to her own story. Many of the story elements of “Past Lives” are autobiographical. Song emigrated from Korea to Canada at age 12. She, like Nora, is a playwright. She currently lives in New York City with a husband she met on a writer’s retreat, like her character. Realizing and respecting the power of her story, Song infuses this film with an unhurried pace that allows real emotions to develop and well-earned insights to come to the surface. Song has the self-confidence to highlight the power of words left unspoken. She uses her technique to convey the insurmountable gulf between two characters who, paradoxically, are standing two feet apart. Like many of the best films, “Past Lives” will serve as an incentive for self-reflection for many moviegoers. You’ll leave the theater pondering the arc of your own story and the crucial “what-ifs” that have affected your own journey. “Past Lives” is a powerful, evocative experience for any moviegoer with a beating heart.'), ('8', 'Lush, elegant, and deeply moving on multiple levels.'), ('10', 'The theme of love has been raised in the cinema many times. And this topic will always be relevant as long as man exists. But the question is how to show and convey excitement through the screen and what emotions you feel.

The two reflect on fate, circumstance, and what might've been had things played out differently in their lives. Written and directed with such a keen eye by Celine Song in her directorial debut, there are so many quiet yet touching moments throughout this beautiful film that made me reflect upon my past and the people and love in my life that has touched or impacted me in various ways or another. The themes of first love, home, chance, happenstance, etc. Are all utilized to great and profound effect here. Storywise, even if I felt as though the film lost its footing a bit in the middle act with its pacing, it still very much moved and impacted me more than a fair amount, with tears being brought to my eyes on more than one occasion. As for the performances, all three of the leads here bring such a sensitive and thoughtful approach to each of their characters, making them feel so genuinely relatable and human in all the best ways. Overall, despite some uncertainty with the pacing at times, this is a film that has a lot to say about love, fate, what was or wasn't meant to be, and why certain people enter our lives."")}"

Another heart to heart goes one while the bad guy is politely waiting to restart the big fight. At other times, the heroes zip in and with this Macguffin or that. It all creates a feeling of stuff happening, and not any kind of story. The original Shazam worked so well because the film moved with the characters. This time around, the characters can hardly keep up at times and have to sit around waiting for their cue at other times. The movie also makes some odd choices for kids film.

Telling a romantic story between two people involved in that world and working in the same hedge fund implies dealing with more than just ordinary moments of love. From the trailer, it can be anticipated that one of the central points of this plot lies in how business corrupts the lives of the main characters and how those around them, especially the female protagonist, consider others as mere disposable objects. Hence the quote I chose. The resulting dynamic between the two immediately generates feelings of resentment when she is promoted, and he is not. One begins to fall behind, and in this context, the plot development, although predictable due to the fact that it is rare for a man to tolerate his partner surpassing his work and economic achievements, whether for reasons of ego or self-esteem, suggests that the relationship has become a ticking time bomb, we just have to wait for the explosion. Admittedly, I feel that Fair Play could have addressed the tensions between the business processes and the power relations and gender in a more focused way rather than concentrating mostly on the conflict of the protagonists' relationship. Nevertheless, generally speaking, I found the film to be competent. However, it lost a full star due to its weak resolution and the lack of nuance and experience in the performances of its actors.

However, once this initial sequence concludes, Fincher applies the same method to all the events that follow and that's where the issues begin.While, in a sense, this is commendable because it shows how dedicated and focused the character is on his task, it also makes him completely one-dimensional, a problem that is reflected in Michael Fassbender's performance, who basically takes what he did with his character David in Prometheus and endows him with a mask of coldness that he never sheds, resulting in a functional but extremely monotonous character.I didn't find The Killer to be a bad film, it maintains a steady pace and progresses without major difficulties, however, it is so self-absorbed in a single tonality that it is inevitable to wonder what the hell David Fincher wanted to tell with this story, which unfortunately is below the quality of what he usually delivers.""), ('9', ""the cinematic so natural it's smooth af""), ('8', 'Sleek, cold, clinical, and challenging.

The film was directed by Adele Lim. She also helped write the screenplay with Cherry Chevapravatdumrong, and Teresa Hsiao. On a personal note, I\'ve been to China many times and love it there! I took two of my sons with me when I went on my first speaking tour. We all fell in love with the people and culture. One of them even married a lovely woman from Hong Kong and now I have an adorable grandson with Chinese in his blood! THINGS I LIKED: I\'m so happy to see Ashley Park in a feature film! I love her in the popular sitcom Emily in Paris. She\'s so talented and beautiful. Other cast members include Debbie Fan, Kenneth Liu, Annie Mumolo, David Denman, and more. There is a sweet storyline about one of the characters going to find her birth mother, yet also recognizing that her adoptive parents are amazing. It\'s fun to go to China in the movie! It\'s a beautiful country filled with rich culture, delicious food, and gentle people. THINGS I DIDN\'T LIKE: The girls are SO crude and vulgar. Why do feminists think the only way to show they are liberated is to be crass and foul? One of the girls states about the Chinese people that ""People around here can tell Chinese-Chinese from American-Chinese."" That\'s so true because Chinese-Chinese people don\'t wear loud, obnoxious colors for the most part or wear Hipster-American clothing. Chinese people are much more reserved and respectful. Characters in the movie slam white people, Americans, Chinese, Christians, and other things. Honestly, this felt like a rated X movie, so I stopped watching it long before it ended. It\'s soooo raunchy and filled with slutty tramps who respect nothing. TIPS FOR PARENTS: This sex-obsessed movie is not appropriate for kids. Lots of profanity and SO many F-bombs. The first word we hear in the movie is an F-bomb. The first word we hear a young child say is an F-bomb. It\'s supposed to be so funny, but it\'s certainly not clever. Young girls flip the bird SO many times. We see sexualized artwork that features male genitalia. Young women talk about sex and genitalia many, many, many times. Mandarin is spoken a lot, mostly with subtitles that have to be read. Lots of alcohol. A bunch of young women do cocaine and hide bags of it in their bodies. We see several people going at it in a variety of ways.'), ('4', ""The film has some moments of effective humor, and genuine chemistry between the leads. However, the filming and editing feel sub par. There is also some heavy leaning on racial stereotypes that is NOT made OK by the fact that the characters themselves are of the same race.

But aside from the raunchy LOL humor, what really got me was the story and its depictions of the challenges that Asian Americans go through in connecting with their ""home country"". As the child of both immigrants and 3 generations of Asian American AND the sibling of an adoptee, I can\'t even begin to describe how many boxes this movie checked for me on a personal level.

Plane,"Jan 13, 2023",1 h 47 m,62,6.5,"{('7', 'IN A NUTSHELL: This is the first movie to hit theaters in 2023. It’s the kind of fun action movie you want to watch while eating buttery popcorn and one that’s filled with cliches and plot holes, yet still an entertaining ride. Critics are calling it vapid, but audiences are loving it. Sit back, put your sense of reality in the locked position, and enjoy your flight! This action-packed flick was directed by Jean-Francois Richet who gives us lots of high-octane moments. The screenplay is by J.P. Davis and Charles Cumming. TIPS FOR PARENTS: Lots of brutal, bloody violence High dead-body count Guns, knives, and hand-to-hand combat People are in perilous situations Tagalog is spoken with subtitles Hostages THINGS I LIKED: Gerard Butler is perfect in this role. He knows how to roll with tension, action, and heart. He sure takes a beating in this one. Another name was pushed for by the studio, but Gerard Butler liked the simple title of Plane. Fun fact: The movie was actually filmed in Puerto Rico, not in Singapore or the Philippines as it states in the actual film. There’s a nice balance of action and time to breathe in between the shoot-em-up scenes. If you already don’t like to fly, this movie will terrify you some more.While the entire movie isn’t shot as a one-take movie, there are some moments that are. I always love the choreography of shots like that. The impressive camerawork is noticeable because there isn’t much CGI. It kind of felt like a fun Die Hard movie where you just can’t overthink anything in order to have a good time. THINGS I DIDN’T LIKE: There are a couple of subplot lines that don’t necessarily go anywhere other than to distract and entertain us. There are some dumb moments that will remind you of 90s action movies, but you’re still going to have fun. The villains are paper-thin and cliched.'), ('10', 'Very successful action film of the classic kind. There is a suspense curve, the story is reasonably logical and the protagonists are believable. You can watch it with friends and beer at the weekend.'), ('7', ""Solidly action packed little movie with good performances by the leads. The side characters, the 'crisis center' the militias and the daughter were perhaps a bit poorly worked out, but the main story was action packed and had a good pace. Despite the killings, to me there was a bit of a Hallmark whiff to it all, with no grey in any of the characters, but not to the extent that it became annoying. Decent action packed movie if you're in the mood.""), ('9', 'Absolutely great movie, should be more movies like this thoroughly enjoyed throughout, great plot and great set of actors combine for a entertaining watch.'), ('3', ""Very stupid screenplay! Could have been much better and more realistic for a 2023 movie! Watchable, if there's nothing else.""), ('5', ""It's a Gerard Butler movie. You know what you're getting. No more, no less.""), ('6', 'Gerard Butler’s an interesting guy. He studied law at the University of Glasgow, but was reportedly fired from his first law firm one week after getting his law license. After establishing himself as an actor, Butler created a production company (it’s now called G-Base Productions) which bankrolls all of his movies. The company’s first commercial success was “Olympus Has Fallen.” It was soon followed by “London Has Fallen” and “Angel Has Fallen.” The company has no known relationship with Life Alert. G-Base’s current offering is “Plane.” Like the movie’s title, the film is a stripped-down, bare bones action film. There are no elaborate set pieces. There’s no extraneous dialogue. The main character has no love interest. Turns out, it’s satisfyingly self-sufficient. Main character a pilot. Plane flies into storm. Plane loses power. Beverage service discontinued. Plane crash-lands in jungle. Good news: plane intact, passengers survive. Bad news: island overrun by ruthless rebel militia. Passengers captured. Pilot must rescue passengers. Entertainingly predictable action ensues. There’s absolutely nothing new here. The story centers on two main characters. Veteran Captain Brodie Torrance (Butler) is flying for a low-rent airline after being caught on video choking out an unruly passenger. He is square-jawed, stoic, but also prone to introspection, of course in a totally manly way. When trying to rescue the passengers, Brodie is led/helped by Louis Gaspare (Mike Colter – “Jessica Jones,” title role in “Luke Cage”). In a surprising development, Gaspare is not a mustache-twirling Frenchman, but a formidable-looking, manacled prisoner convicted of capital murder who once served in the French Foreign Legion. Mon dieu. Both actors are excellent. There’s something refreshing about a movie willing to just do simple things well. Here, the creative team is self-confident enough to tell a story without diversion, subterfuge or distracting subplots and to still believe their effort will satisfy the audience. In other words, welcome to the 1990s. Think of “Plane” as furthering the tradition of “Con Air” and “Air Force One.” That’s not to say the finished product is flawless. At one point, Brodie voluntarily goes to the captors and offers himself in place of the captured passengers. It’s a little too messianic. But perhaps this airline has created a frequent flyer program where loyalty works both ways. If you’re looking for two hours of pleasant diversion, this film is strongly recommended. It’s ideal for the moviegoer who found “Top Gun: Maverick” a little too complicated.'), ('3', ""It's your average, simplistic, situational movie that features little action and mostly is just a lot of talking and walking. This should have been a lot more entertaining than it was.""), ('6', ""Gerard Butler plays a pilot whose plane has a forced landing on a remote island ruled by warring rebels. There are actually 2 movies here: The flight, which is pretty gripping, and the fight, which is standard action fare. There's tension building up to the emergency landing, but once they arrive in the jungle the threats become human and not especially intimidating. The rescue attempt has lots of gunfire, but not much else. Once you've experienced the entire movie, the absurdity of the premise becomes even more ridiculous.

Good action. Good side story. Good acting. All in all a good action thriller to eat popcorn watching. We give it a ""yea, worth watching.""'), ('3', 'Mostly pointless with poor acting! Butler is a captain come mercenary??? Must do better!'), ('6', ""Whenever there is a film starring Gerard Butler in the lead, you automatically think that it is going to be a leave-your-brain-at-home-action bonanza. I thought Plane would be no different, especially when I viewed the trailer. But yet again, I was surprised with the warm reception the film got and on Monday, I made it a point to go and watch this film. Suffice to say, just like the rest, I was surprised and impressed as well. Plane isn't just an action film. It is a thriller as well and all in all a good entertainer. Of course I am not giving away any spoilers but from what the trailer shows, it is a story centered around a Airplane Pilot Brodie Torrance (Gerard Butler) and what unfolds on new year's eve with him and his passengers and crew. The 1st half of the film is a pure thrill ride and it keeps you glued to your seat, although you know what is going to happen, you still want to see it unfold. You might think that the 2nd half of the film is gonna be a Rambo-like film but actually it isn't which is a good thing and honestly a great approach to a predictable plot. Performance wise, of course it is Gerard Butler who is the star of the show, since the entire story revolves around his character. After him it is Mike Colter who has done a good job although, he doesn't have much to do accept beat up the bad guys. The Supporting cast and do their adequate best in their respective roles. Charles Cumming and J. P. Davis who have written the script should be acknowledged because Plane is a film you go in expecting the same-old, same-old action madness but you come out satisfied because it isn't that. Director Jean-François Richet has done a good job 'merging' two genres into one. Kudos to him for this attempt and waiting to see more from him. In conclusion, Plane is a good entertainer because it tries to be different and for that I give it accolades. Go for it if you like Pure-Popcorn-Entertainment.""), ('6', 'While there are few suprises to be found in this predictable disaster/action / survival/ thriller mashup. In spite of this it is done with such a wink and a nod to the audience that it is hard not to smile and be entertained by it all. Butler and colter shine throughout with a decent turn in from the supporting cast too.'), ('7', 'This movie was quite thrilling and old school. The kind of action thriller the 90’s would have gave us. Gerald Butler got the most credit by the positive Rottem Tomatoes reviews. As a pilot trying to save his plane and passengers when they land on enemy territory. Mike Colter (Evil, Luke Cage) shows that he can easily be a bad ass action hero as well. The only thing bad about Mike’s character is that we don’t really learn enough about him. Other than he killed someone and was a prisoner on the plane. With him of course Butler’s best hope to get away.'), ('7', ""PLANE was better than it had any right to be. It is a shining example of what a fun action popcorn movie that doesn't take itself too seriously should be.""), ('7', 'I enjoyed it - it had action, it had real settings, it had story which could be real for most of it and it was interesting to watch throughout. Therefore decent movie'), ('6', 'If your plane is going to crashland on an Island even the nearby governments are too afraid to go near, well then it’s a good thing your pilot is Gerard Butler. Brodie Torrance (Gerard Butler) is a pilot, a father and only delighted to be on his way home to his daughter for New Years after one last flight. Well on what should have been a routine flight ends badly during a lightning strike and they are forced to “land” on a war torn Island. Better than landing on the water right? Wrong, turns out from all the places they could have landed, the Island is filled with dangerous rebels practically queuing up to get shot and battered by Gerard Butler. Turns out “the crash was just the beginning.” Gerard Butler must now find a way to get help while also protected the passengers from these dangerous criminals. Plane is a mindless action flick that writes itself, offers no real surprises but is entertaining in the moment and does the job. It’s fast paced, wastes absolutely no time getting going and is just an all-round fun movie. There’s also enough time allowed to set up the characters before things go south so you’re invested enough in the story to care what happens. The fight scenes are very well shot, none of this over the top shaky cam stuff. It’s actually clear to see each and every vicious punch to the head. It’s not exactly going to go down in history as one of the best action movies ever made but it’s enjoyable all the same. Pretty sure the only reason anyone is seeing Plane is for Gerard Butler. It’s definitely one of his better movies, and believe me I’ve seen some of his worst ones (yeah I’m looking at you Gods of Egypt), so when I say Plane is a decent movie you can trust me. If there’s one thing cinemas will never be short of is an action star thrown into a perilous situation and must save the day before it’s too late. Plane is actually what it advertises, no more and no less. If you’re looking for something different to all the award contenders right now, then look no further, Plane has you covered. Highly recommended for all the diehard Gerard Butler fans.')}"
You Hurt My Feelings,"May 26, 2023",1 h 33 m,80,6.3,"{('7', ""Julia Louis-Dreyfuss and Tobias Menzies star as a married couple who find themselves in an awkward impasse when she overhears him criticizing her latest book, causing their friends, family, and fellow couples around them to reexamine their honest feelings towards each other as well. It's a rather simple and straightforward comedy, but that's what ends up making it so enjoyable and it's undeniably full of heart, charm, and some genuinely funny moments, even if some of the humorous scenes and moments are played a little too safely at times. Dreyfuss and Menzies make for such a charming pair on screen, and their chemistry is undeniable, with some other humorous and worthwhile appearances from other notable faces, such as real-life married acting couple David Cross and Amber Tamblyn. Nicole Holofcener's sharp and keen eye to writing and directing shines brilliantly through here, and you can tell she really understands the couple dynamics quite well. Overall, though simple and straightforward, it's still surprisingly funny, heartfelt, and just a plain old good time.""), ('7', ""You Hurt My Feelings is a film that can come across as too specifically detailed for it to feel more genuine and natural. Part of me shares this sentiment, but it effectively overcomes this challenge thanks to the excellent performances of its actors, especially Julia Louis-Dreyfus. While it may give off an initial impression of triviality and simplicity, the film soon transforms into the type of indie drama and comedy that offers more depth than expected, ultimately proving to be a highly rewarding experience. Indeed, it is a small-scale production, but it leaves a positive impression, both for its impressive craftsmanship and the relevance of its subject matter. The moral of the story is simple and straightforward, yet it addresses an issue that many of us tend to avoid. Give it a shot. It's a good film.""), ('6', '“You Hurt My Feelings” is an inspired title. It effectively summarizes all the action that takes place in the course of this film, while simultaneously capturing what’s at stake here. Beth (Julia Louis-Dreyfus – “Veep,” “Seinfeld”) has been laboring to write a novel, a follow-up to her modestly well-received memoir. Her husband Don (Tobias Menzies – Prince Philip in “The Crown”) has read twenty drafts of the novel, offering vague encouragement following each reading. Beth overhears Don telling a friend that he really didn’t like his wife’s novel. Beth is distraught. What follows is a meditation on “little white lies.” Is superficial lying a necessary lubricant for human relationships, as some have proposed? Alternatively, are truly solid relationships built on an unfaltering honesty in which any form of untruth has no place? It’s an interesting question. Regrettably, even through the final scene of this film, Writer/Director Nicole Holofcener steadfastly refuses to take a position. “You Hurt My Feelings” includes several positive elements that make the film worth seeing. Holofcener’s script includes keenly-observed, rich female characters. (The males here are not so fortunate.) At times, the dialogue crackles with cleverness. And the cast is first-rate. Julia Louis-Dreyfus is multi-dimensional, compelling and appealing as a character who doesn’t rely on the self-absorbed snark she deployed constantly in “Veep.” Michaela Watkins, an alumna along with Louis-Dreyfus of Holofcener’s previous film “Enough Said,” is excellent as Sarah, Beth’s sister. Arian Moayed (“Succession,” “Inventing Anna”) is outstanding as Sarah’s husband, a tortured actor who is mesmerized by socks. Professional critics have adored this film, bestowing upon it the ultimate accolade of “grown-up movie,” presumably since “adult film” was already taken. This seems a fair assessment, since young adults will have little or no tolerance for its nothing-at-stake “action” and children will sleep through the proceedings. Overall, “You Hurt My Feelings” is a story about people who have the luxury to fixate on incidents, not real crises. They are New Yorkers who vacillate between oblivious self-absorption and an awareness of others that inevitably generates neurotic anxiety. In other words, for better or worse, you’re likely to feel as if you’ve been suddenly thrown into an old Woody Allen movie. If you want to see all of this done better, re-watch “Annie Hall.”'), ('9', 'You Hurt My Feelings is profoundly entertaining and deeply emotional at the same time.

The Holdovers,"Oct 27, 2023",2 h 13 m,80,7.4,"{('10', 'Pure cinematic nostalgia. I was reminded of a time in life; my version of these events. Payne makes coming-of-age stories about grown ups. As if there were an important basic childhood lesson that was missed, which creates a hole that needs to get smoothed over. Since this movie is set over the holidays, we have our Scrooge character and then we have various archetypes, or values, presented by other characters. Do we have more in common with others that we thought? Are we missing out on friendships right under our nose? Is life about adjusting to certain discomforts or radically rejecting them until we achieve satisfaction? There are some profound moments in the film, and they are all deftly handled with a lot of organic breathing room given to the actors to feel out the scene. The beautiful production design (including the choices of camera, film (?), color) sets the stage for the actors to really step into the shoes of the characters. All the performances are good and memorable down to the smallest part. That’s all I would need to say about the direction. The script is fantastic. I haven’t read it, but it feels brought to life accurately. I can feel the script in the film but not in a stuffy way. It has structure, pathos and great little moments that are brought to life through creative interpretation. It feels like a well considered film, neither too far a drama or a comedy; as Dramedies go I’d say it’s 50/50. Many moments are fun and poignant at the same time. I expect The Holdovers to be even more poignant on second viewing now knowing the characters’ full arcs. What impresses me so much about the characters is that they arrive fully formed, they are fully formed throughout, and it ends with them fully formed. Yes there is character growth, but it’s that character growing, not being re-written into someone they weren’t already to begin with. The actors are given a lot of bandwidth to continually bring out different aspects of their characters so nothing feels out of place later whether it’s an aggression or a kindness. Someone can be harsh in one moment, and nice to someone in the next. That’s what life is like. There’s not a firm line between “hero” and “villain” like in many works of fiction. Everyone is the “hero” of their own journey, but sometimes they took an arrow without realizing it. And not until they stop blindly moving forward (or half blind?) for a holiday break can they realize where damage was done, pull out the arrow, and make the necessary adjustments to turn the next page of their hero’s journey. The Holdovers is a beautifully story, well told, and a reminder that the scope of a film can be epic even in small moments as long as we understand who the characters are and their choices have weight. 9.5/10'), ('8', ""In this latest offering from director Alexander Payne ('Election', 'Sideways', 'The Descendants', etc.), set in the 70s, a grumpy and contentious college history professor (Paul Giamatti) finds himself stuck on campus watching over the handful of young men unable to return home for the holidays for various reasons, and finds himself unexpectedly bonding and sympathizing with a particularly troubled young student (Dominic Sessa in an incredible debut). First of all, I didn't have too high of expectations going into this one, because truth be told, I've never really been all that big on Alexander Payne films. They've typically never been my cup of tea, as I find them a little too straightforward, pedestrian, or simply not funny or memorable enough. Most people seem to love his sophomore film 'Election', which I always found incredibly overrated and populated with nothing but unlikable characters. 'The Descendants' was cute and at times emotional, but also mostly forgettable in my eyes. And 'Nebraska' was simply boring and too understated. The only film of his I've ever truly loved is 'Sideways', which was full of wit, humor, and heart. Coincidentally enough, this was the only other time him and Giamatti worked together, that is until this film of course. And after watching this one, I've come to the conclusion that both of these men collaborating together creates pure onscreen magic, because I absolutely adored just about every minute of this funny, heartwarming, and charming little film. And yes, this is largely in part thanks to Giamatti and his brash yet yet compelling and humorous performance, but his chemistry and onscreen charisma and presence, particularly with newcomer Dominic Sessa is also the film's biggest highlight by far. However , Davine Joy Randolph also gives a superb supporting turn here as well. In addition, the screenplay and dialogue is witty and heartwarming in all the right places. Overall, this is a surprising yet very welcome return to form for Payne, and a long overdue reunion between him and Giamatti. I also now consider it the only other truly great film from Payne besides 'Sideways', which to me says a lot. I'm certain it'll charm and delight the pants off of most folks like it did me."")}"
Theater Camp,"Jul 14, 2023",1 h 32 m,70,6.8,"{('8', 'I actually really liked the tone of this film. I watched it with my friends in a theater and I kind of liked it. The humor was funny all the way and I like how optimistic the theater camp is.'), ('3', 'bad [ bad ] adjective, worse, worst;(Slang) bad·der, bad·dest for 36. not good in any manner or degree.'), ('6', 'Films in the mockumentary genre can be thoroughly satisfying entertainment experiences when done right, as seen in such examples as “Zelig” (1983), “This Is Spinal Tap” (1984) and “Fear of a Black Hat” (1993). But the key, as noted above, is in doing them right, something to which this latest such offering from writer-directors Nick Lieberman and Molly Gordon can’t lay claim. The problem here is that the picture is too hit or miss on too many fronts: When it’s on, it’s brilliant and genuinely hilarious (especially in the film’s final act); however, when it’s not, it tries too hard to be funny and often ends up falling flat. That’s unfortunate, since the picture’s high points – as good as they are – simply aren’t enough to make up for the low ones. This faux look into life at an Adirondack theatrical-themed summer camp for youngsters and teens has a few too many diverse story threads that stray from the picture’s central premise. Then there are the characterizations, which are truly well developed but focus more on the camp’s adult staffers than on the characters that should matter most – the campers themselves. What’s more, the narrative relies heavily on the use of graphics to move the story along, but they frequently stay on the screen for unduly short durations, a practice that becomes progressively irritating over time. In all, this is a production that feels half-finished, one sorely in need of tidying up to make it work as well as it might have. Perhaps that’s due in part to the picture’s volume of material – 70 hours of footage – but that abundance of images likely wasn’t culled as effectively as it might have been. It feels as if the film aspires to be like one of Christopher Guest’s mockumentary projects (most notably “Waiting for Guffman” (1996)) but just doesn’t quite come up to the same level, despite a strong underlying basis that should have leant itself well to this format. To be sure, this is by no means an awful release; it makes for a modestly pleasant at-home streaming option for a midweek evening. It’s just regrettable that it doesn’t live up to what it could have been.'), ('8', 'IN A NUTSHELL: I used to take dance, singing, and theater classes when I was a little girl and into my teens, so I really got a kick out of this movie. It’s about an eccentric staff of a rundown theater camp in upstate New York during a summer when the founder’s stroke put her in a coma. Her “bro-y” son had to figure out how to keep the camp afloat in her absence as the financial future of the camp is hanging in the balance. The entertaining film was written and directed by Molly Gordon and Nick Lieberman with additional writing help from Noah Galvin. This is Molly’s and Nick’s directorial debut. They, clearly, had a blast putting this movie together. It makes for a fun summer movie. The movie has already won “Best Ensemble” at the Sundance Film Festival. It was also nominated for other awards at other film festivals at Sundance, SXSW, and Seattle International. THINGS I LIKED: More Ben Platt, please! I just love his voice. He and Noah Galvin are a couple in real life. They both played the starring role in Dear Evan Hansen. Such a great stage play and movie! The rest of the talented cast includes Caroline Aaron, Nathan Lee Graham, Molly Gordon, Jimmy Tatro, Patti Harrison, Amy Sedaris, and so many young kids who just got their break in movies! There are some truly talented kids in the movie. The story is filmed like a mockumentary and absolutely doesn’t take itself too seriously. There is a lot of spoken and visual humor. Thespians will be the ones that enjoy it the most. The cards on the screen give us entertaining and often hilarious background information during the entire movie. The ending is actually really sweet and touching. We get to hear a lot of original music with amusing lyrics. Fun fact #1: The film was shot in only 19 days, resulting in a whopping 70 hours of footage! It must have been painful to try to weed through all of the footage and cut so much out. Fun fact #2: They filmed the movie at the URJ Kutz camp in Warwick, New York. Sadly, the camp is now closed, another reminder that we need to help support our local companies and the arts. THINGS I DIDN’T LIKE: Act 1 establishes the characters and the goofiness, but the plot really doesn’t present itself until Act 3 when it’s quickly resolved. People who aren’t into musical theater or plays might not think the humor is very funny. TIPS FOR PARENTS: Profanity, including an F-bomb Visual and spoken jokes about doing cocaine. Lots of children and adults in the LGBTQ+ community are represented.'), ('6', ""This faux doc is set in a summer camp for theatre kids. Ben Platt & Molly Gordon play 2 instructors, who also create an original musical every summer. (The actors actually met when they were kids at a camp like this and Gordon co-wrote & co-directed.) While the teachers are satirized with their affected seriousness, the young actors show lots of talent. Because everyone was encouraged to improvise, it has a loose feeling, but not a lot of sharp, comic moments. The original songs are tuneful and appropriately trite. This was shot with a grainy, low-budget style that adds to the immediacy. Even though it's trying hard to amuse, it's seldom funny, but it's obvious that everyone involved loves the theatre and that shines thru. Inevitable comparison to Waiting for Guffman are only in concept, because it was a lot better all around.""), ('9', 'Really enjoyed this. Lots of humour with great performances from the younger cast. Will get lost with all the big releases but definitely deserves to be seen.'), ('6', ""Theater Camp's humor is genuine, and I think it proves to be its best weapon in separating itself from what could have become a very simple mockumentary. It may give the impression that you have to be a theater lover to get into the spirit of its plot, but I think even casual viewers will be able to relate to its approach. Not everything functions seamlessly, and at certain points, I experienced a slight sense of disconnection. However, the humor operates at an optimal level, effectively getting the laughs it's looking for. It may not leave a brutal impression on you and you may not enjoy its melodies either, but i believe you won't be bored.""), ('8', 'If you were a musical theater kid growing up, this film is for you. If you are the sibling of a theater kid growing up, this film is for you. If you were a stage designer, set hand or cast member, this is the film to bring you back to your childhood and flood it with so many nostalgic memories you will want to see this movie again and again and again. This mockumentary-style film centres around two counsellors at a theater camp who were child prodigies and, while they never made it to Broadway, come back each year as counsellors, trying to live their dreams through the up-and-coming young campers. Together, they go through the stages of horrible auditions, rejections, rehearsals and school camp politics to deliver a wildly entertaining film that stands out as one of the year’s best comedies. Joan Rubinsky (Amy Sedaris) is the proud owner of Camp ArdinoidACTS in upstate New York. After a strobe light incident sends her into a coma right before the start of the new summer camp season, her son Troy (Jimy Tatro), who has no idea about the camp, is left in charge to save it from the woes from the bank. While sifting through the mess, the camp counsellors led by Amos (Ben Platt) and Rebecca-Diane (Molly Gordon) strut around like superstars, inflicting their unresolved hopes and dreams on the kids at the camp. When it’s revealed that the camp is in financial distress and something must be done to save it. Fortunately, this all too overused cliche is wafted out by the kids who reject capitalism and just want to perform on stage which takes this film into an entertaining twist. It is a wild 90 minutes packed full of jokes and zingers that you will need to watch several times to fully grasp the breadth of what they are doing here. Through all of the jokes and the brutally honest stabs is a heart and sweetness that shines through each character and the core of what this camp means to everyone involved. This is only amplified through the performances of the cast, Platt and Gordon are the clear standouts here, guiding the story and cast. Ayo Edebiri has a great stint as a dry character, leading the stage fighting workshops and specialising in mime. There are obvious comparisons here to 2003’s Camp with an infusion of Wet Hot American Summer, while clear influences, this movie still manages to carve out its own path resulting in some big laughs and a memorable movie you will want to revisit. There are some original songs in this with some truly terrible lyrics that only add to the laughs and charm. Theater Camp is truly firing on all comedic cylinders, it understands every bit of this experience and the emotional rollercoaster of being involved in a live performance both on and off stage. While a lot of the attention is on the main adults, there is much to be said about the kids involved who truly give their all to solidify an incredible film. Platt and Gordon have truly crafted one of the years best comedies you will want to watch over and over.')}"

The zany jokes that a movie like this should have are missing; the comical moments here can't provide more than a smile.

Some of the representation was spot on too, it\'s rare to see decently written platonic lesbians. HOWEVER there is tons of punching down, and the main character complaining about ugly women wasn\'t really funny considering the movie was devoid of ugly women as far as I remember. Some of the dialogue was also a bit cringe inducing, mostly Rachel Sennot forcing her lines (not her fault imo, she had terrible lines), or Ayo Edebiri doing a carbon copy of her stressed speed ranting from The Bear. Lastly I know we\'re doing a ""raunchy"" comedy but it was kind of odd how it only sexually objectified the women, and it did it a LOT. Overall I just get mixed messages from this movie.

Lots of Megs this time, not just one, because that will make it better than the first movie right? Sorry lads, not only is this sequel not better than The Meg it’s somehow worse. Can someone explain to me how you make a movie about giant sharks boring? Somehow they managed it because a movie about giant sharks should be anything but boring. The worlds “smartest” scientists apparently didn’t learn their lesson that took place in the first movie four years previous and they continue their exploration of the deepest depths of the ocean. Since we last saw the team, they now have a Meg in captivity, as you do. But don’t worry it’s very secure and no chance the Meg will escape at any point. Statham and his team go on yet another mission down in the Mariana Trench, home to the Megs and some other ancient sea life, because that’ll end well. Due to some complications, they accidently blow a huge hole in the thermal layer, you know the only thing keeping all the scary prehistoric creatures away from the rest of the ocean. Well they blow a hole through that again and unleash the Megs onto the world. Here we go again, who could have possibly foreseen this and doesn’t this all feel very familiar? For anyone wondering why The Meg even got a sequel at all it made a boatload of money in the cinemas. Lucky for us that means more Megs, but even getting director Ben Wheatley on-board wasn’t enough to rescue this mess. Meg 2: The Trench forgot it’s entire audience only want to see a bunch of Megalodons chomp on everything in the ocean for 90 minutes. We’re not here for the eco-terrorists, and corruption storylines with half-assed, one dimensional villains. Again it fell into the same trap as the first Meg and took itself way too seriously. I felt stupid watching this movie and at about the halfway mark all I could think of is there’s very little Megs in this Meg movie. The many unnecessary plot lines are stupid, the acting is stupid, the script is stupid and the Oscar for most underwhelming monsters in a monster movie goes to all the Megs that appeared in Meg 2: The Trench. They were absolutely useless and got upstaged in their own movie. The first Meg movie had a similar problem in that it took itself way too seriously and didn’t have enough people getting chomped on. Like it’s a movie about a giant shark, if it plays out as a serious movie like Jaws then it’s set itself up for failure from the beginning. Having Ben Wheatley (Kill List, High-Rise) take over the franchise honestly didn’t make any difference, and I can only guess he needed a quick paycheque so I hope it was worth it. Even with ultra-low expectations, Meg 2 was a giant disappointment. It fails as an action movie and it fails as a monster movie. It doesn’t even deliver what it promises and the Megs ultimately get upstaged by some other prehistoric creatures and boring subplots. I just wanted a cheesy, entertaining monster movie. That’s all I wanted, is that too much to ask? Like it’s predecessor, it doesn’t have nearly enough laughs to place it in the “so bad it’s good” category. Honestly I got more laughs watching Lavalantula (yes it’s a real movie) than I did watching Meg 2: The Trench. Recommended for anyone who thinks Jaws: The Revenge is a masterpiece, but honestly if you want a shark movie that actually falls into the “so bad it’s good” category, Deep Blue Sea or Sharknado are better choices than Meg 2: The Trench.'), ('6', ""Not bad , that's me laught ...""), ('6', ""It's okay, saved by its ridiculous plot and ideas, but what's bad about this film is that it tries to push a story and for some, it may be weird if you haven't watched the first film.

At times it felt like Underwater Star Wars, but of course, the writing, the dialogue, and the acting are pretty poor.

The love interest/ wife or whatever she was who just never came back had a daughter with Jason Statham's character who doesn't even act like its his daughter. The tone of the script is just clueless.

With her young blind son as the only witness, she must defend herself while also coming to terms with her past with her late husband and her relationship with her son. Directed by Justine Triet, this French film is at first glance a rather typical courtroom procedural drama. And while this is rather true in some senses, it also takes some interesting and unexpected turns, particularly in the latter half of the film as things become more clear and apparent with the trial and everything leading up to it. And while I felt as though it played things relatively safe and pedestrian for the most part, the story remains compelling enough in its own right, and Huller gives an absolute tour de force performance here. Even the young boy playing her son here also has some solid moments to shine in the film's second half in particular. Overall, it's a rather standard courtroom procedural, but some of the unexpected turns it takes midway through, along with the stellar performances from all involved make this one a worthwhile enough watch.

Poker Face (2023),"Jan 26, 2023",2 Seasons,84,6.5,"{('6', 'Reminds me of the old Ellery Queen show where they gave you the clues and Jim Hutton would break the fourth wall and ask, “Have you solved it yet?” In this case they drop a heavy-handed, non sequitur clue you can only miss if not paying attention. Kind of takes the fun out of the detection part! The lead is quirky, but she’s not compelling. Good actors helped the premier.'), ('9', ""Outstanding show so far. Perfectly cast and great writing. Natasha Lyonne is very entertaining to watch and easily carries the lead role. I'd say it's on or near the same quality as Columbo, and that's saying a lot.""), ('8', '(Ep 1 ""Dead Man\'s Hand"" + Ep 2 ""The Night Shift"") A waitress named Charlie with a gift for detecting deception gets recruited by a casino boss to exploit a high-roller\'s poker game, while she deals with her friend\'s violent murder. Charlie then hits the road, but finds herself poking around the apparent wrongful arrest of a helpful trucker she meets at a remote rest stop. Charlie is played by Natasha Lyonne as a Columbo-type sleuth who is also a self-described dumbass. Like Columbo she is usually an apologetic and unthreatening interrogator, but unlike Columbo you know that sometimes she is not just PLAYING dumb. She keeps stumbling into obstacles or solutions without knowing how or if she can master or learn from the experience. The nominal hook for the series is Charlie\'s seemingly infallible gift for smelling out intentionally deceptive utterances. That ability gets less focus in the initial episodes than one might expect, and is downplayed by Charlie herself as a source of frustration and confusion.I expect from Rian Johnston\'s past screenwriting that POKER FACE will eventually mine the premise for clever twists and payoffs. However, that isn’t strongly evident in the openering stories. They presumably have to focus more on establishing the character and the series\' plot arc. These lean engaging and clear mystery/crime storytelling that is still pretty conventional. If anything, POKER FACE is more distinguished by how Charlie\'s amateur investigator status lends dramatic weight to her personal confrontations with perpetrators. This show is a great vehicle for Natasha Lyonne\'s anti-glamorous screen persona as a bed-headed working-class day-drinker. She gets the best moments in the episodes viewed: an excited off-screen reaction to a luxurious private chamber; and a charming delivery of the line, ""I\'m gonna... accept this situation."": her bemused reaction to waking up somewhere unexpected. A low-expectations attitude to her abilities and to looming threats make her an exception to the variously committed and well-resourced law-enforcement and P.I. types who populate crime shows. It makes it harder for writers to insert high stakes into her stories, but it does make her more relatable. By default she wants to ignore people\'s lies and manipulations and avoid involvement, but she is torn by the impulse to keep poking her nose where it is not welcome because something just doesn\'t feel right. Rather than being a crime buster straight out of the gate, she is going to have to learn as she goes without much support. You could say that Charlie is the detective character updated for the current generation living in the casual-employment/gig-work/side-hustle economy. Outside of the likeable lead, most of the other elements of the series are pretty solid, if occasionally requiring some commitment from the viewer . The hour-plus run times that streaming makes possible enabled lots of setup for ongoing character arcs in episode one but also was used to lay out multiple additional characters in the new setting Charlie arrives at while on the road in episode two. Hopefully the episode scripts get a bit tighter as the series progresses. The first two episodes use a version of the crime solving narrative format used in Columbo and Law and Order: Criminal Intent. That is, we are shown up front the events of the crime, and the question to be resolved is not whodunnit but how close will they get to getting away with it before the investigator gets involved and then catches them out. The specific non-linear narrative structure used here - in which the action starts with the crime then the timeline flashes back to before Charlie crosses paths with those events - could quickly get old if repeated consistently. (Unless, perhaps, the writers play around with some variations of it.) The show’s production has a retro feel, utilising seventies/eighties era colours and fonts for the credits, and a tendency to lean on in-camera or otherwise low-tech methods to add expressive visuals. For example, a youth’s alienation is flagged by shooting his point of view watching a flirting couple through the smudged pane of a frosted refrigerator door in a store. The success of the show will depend on how well it combines an ongoing arc for Charlie with standalone crime of the week stories. There is apparently a packed cast of name actors slated for future episodes. John Ratzenberger in episode two provides a solid but non-showy performance in a supporting role, while the casino boss in ep one gave Adrian Brody a chance to deliver a dense backstory in the enjoyable form of a rhythmically flowing yarn. So, the uses the guest cast are put to will probably vary. The mildly taxing screen time demands of setting up a new scenario in each episode lost them half a star. Otherwise episodes went down easy, combining humour and dramatic tension in clear and enjoyable ways. This is almost certainly a worthwhile series to follow.'), ('5', ""The first two episodes are engaging and fun, with great cinematography. The show becomes increasingly formulaic with less mystery and less believability in each new episode. I'd say it's a 7 for the first 2 episodes, trending towards a 4 later in the season.

Ellie might have been presented with the hard choice of sacrificing herself in order to maybe save the human race. I mean, she spent most of the first season risking her life to maybe save the human race, but in the end the people creating the show made the deliberate choice to give us the triumph of selfishness over heroism. They turned Ellie into a victim and made Joel appear like a monster who kills half the people trying to save the human race. Oh, you might say, but Joel was trying to save Ellie. Sure, he probably saw it that way. But the problem is we the audience don\'t really know what\'s happening because we weren\'t shown what happened to Ellie while Joel was unconscious. Was she offered a choice? Was she treated like a lab rat with no rights? The most important plot point in the show and we\'ll never know the answer because the show runners either lacked the nerve to put it on screen or don\'t know the difference between good and evil. And based on what I saw on the screen the story ends with the human race doomed thanks in part to one man\'s evil. There are other problems, too. Like the flashlight batteries still holding a charge 20 years after. Like the ""survivalist"" relying on gasoline and diesel fuel long after either would have degraded into garbage. Like the dam still supplying some people with electricity, because, you know, Jesus descended from the Heavens to ensure that the people with the technical background to keep a hydroelectric station running would still be on the job. Like the zombies. Not because it\'s fungus turning people into zombies. Because I read about fungus and bugs years ago so matching the fungus with people isn\'t that big of a leap. The problem here is that the zombies, on the rare occasions when we see them, look like something out of a Troma release. It doesn\'t matter if you start the film with scientists explaining that fungus zombies are a real possibility if the zombies you put on-screen look like some no-budget 1950s movie monster.

Frasier (2023),"Oct 12, 2023",1 Season,56,7.5,"{('4', 'Very dated (studio audience with a laugh track). Not too funny. :-( Our view is: ""skip it and watch the old Frazier if you must.""'), ('10', 'The original show is my favourite show of all time, and I regard it as one of the best comedies ever written—as do many. So naturally, I was both excited and terrified when I heard it was coming back. Now that it\'s here, and I\'ve had a chance to see the first two episodes, I\'m optimistic. It\'s the same in some ways, different in others, and I get the impression that a tad more thought and care has gone into it than is the norm these days. I can appreciate that, at the very least. Kelsey is great, but the guy played Frasier for twenty years, then spent the next twenty years doing impressions of him for every second fan he met. So yeah, he gets it, he could portray the character whilst in a coma, enough said; there was never a chance he\'d be what let the show down. The rest of the characters are all competently acted even if conservatively conceived. Clearly the intention is to replicate the main archetypes from the original show. As I said, that\'s a very conservative choice, but okay, I can roll with it. I don\'t particularly care if an idea is original, just that it\'s well executed. Over the first two episodes, it\'s impossible to call, but there\'s a decent foundation that can be built upon. The writing is solid, but you can tell it\'s been written in a different day and age. There are some definitive ""old-school"" Frasier moments that conjure up or lean more on nostalgia, as well as more contemporary touches that would feel right at home in any other modern sitcom, but that will stand out to fans of the original. The latter aren\'t bad, just different, more mainstream. Given time, this new melding of tone could end up being the originality that the fundamental ideas lack. Plot-wise I must admit, the stories from both episodes hit me in the feels. This might be where my objectivity fades and I ""fanboy out"" a bit. You have been warned. Freddy relating to his grandfather\'s death on another level in episode one struck a chord. A touch contrived, maybe, but the weight of John Mahoney\'s impeccable portrayal of Martin hung over that whole scene so it was earned nonetheless. We can only imagine how proud Martin was of his firefighting grandson, so it fits. The flag from Martin\'s casket helping to build the bridge between Frasier and Freddy was amazing (my wife was in tears). The father and son in this episode aren\'t as estranged as Martin and Frasier were—nor would it make sense if they were—they just needed a dash of common sense. Martin was always full of that. The second episode was even more impressive than the first, culminating in the most satisfying Darth Vader parody I\'ve ever seen. Frasier contriving the ridiculous story of Freddy\'s lineage to help his son save face in front of his friends was such a Frasier thing to do. How many times have fans seen Frasier relentlessly pursue something out of pure selfishness, only to turn his attention to a person more in need because of his good nature (i.e. ""The 1,000th Show"", ""Death Becomes Him""). He could have rubbed it in more, or taken the moment entirely for himself, but that\'s not the Frasier we know and love. When push comes to shove, Frasier won\'t throw anyone under the bus whatever the cost to him personally. The fact that the writers and show-runners seem to know that, gives me hope… just maybe, they all get it, and will do the show justice. I\'m giving it a 10, not because it was perfect, but because nothing about it detracted from my experience so much that I was anything other than overjoyed about having more Frasier to watch. And that\'s the point, ultimately… it feels like I\'m watching a continuation of something worthwhile, and no reboot of a TV show I\'ve seen before now has ever felt that way. Reboots of this caliber should be the norm and are instead the exception, which is very saddening.'), ('10', ""Let's be very clear here: a lot of vitriol around this reboot falls into one of two categories; people too love Drunk on the Last series, angry it's not season 12 of Frasier, with the entire original cast, a lot of that died with John Mahoney. Next is legacy media, furious about the man behind the character, Kelsey Grammer, a very loud conservative in a far-left industry. They are chomping at the bit to destroy this man. They can't handle him having any more success than he already did. (Literally, all the worst reviews read like a list of the top media giants in the country, as if they are all repeating a scripted response). Look, it's a fresh series with James Burrows in the Director's Chair, the co-creator of Cheers and The Mary Tyler Moore Show, it will continue to get better and better the more room it gets to breath, and I have high confidence it will land well by the end of season 1 with most people, and season 2 like all good sitcoms will be in part based on the feedback of season 1. Remember this, Season 1 of the Office barely managed a higher score then this and still to this day sits at a 66. Remember, many people decrying this reboot know this and just want to make sure it doesn't happen. It's a silly world we live in, now go enjoy some Frasier and decide for yourself! :)""), ('10', ""It is an outstanding start for a new series; what I did not want to see was Frasier season 12; instead, this series takes place 20 years later, and Frasier is now in a very different stage of his life. Some things never change, but in otherways, his focus is different., I also appreciate as someone who rebelled hard against one of my parents as well, Freddy feels like a logical outcome as Frasier, though loving, has always been self-absorbed and obsessed with outward things. I like the new cast, it's fun seeing how Frasier fits into their lives and vice versa, it's a solid beginning to something new, the only character I struggled with was his Nephew feels a little out of place, but I'm open to it, and it seems like a fun actor playing the role. Genuinely excited for the rest of season 1!""), ('9', 'I mean we got a new season of Frasier, it’s good, I’m holding out until I see all ten episodes, might come back and change this score later if it really bombs in my opinion, but otherwise it’s exactly what the trailers showed us.

But you know what? I like it. I like it a lot. I had moments where I forgot I was watching the new show and thought I was watching Frasier. It was good, and the new cast is already growing on me. I was sad the Niles and Daphne didn't have any cameo at all, and their son is by far the most under developed character as he's in the least amount of scenes, and they play him as a caricature of his parents since their missing. Still, I'm grateful the show is on the air, gives me something very different to watch these days. Keep in mind one the top shows today is literally about naked people on an island dating lol I miss this more wholesome stuff, plus watched it with my dad, big Frasier fan himself, and he was like it was okay, not bad, just okay and he told me he was just glad to see Kelsey Grammer back doing such a beloved character again, I'll make sure to come back and update this by the end of this first season, here's hoping it just gets better and better from here!""), ('6', ""Better than I was expecting but Rodney is in it.

It's literally more of Kelsey Grammer playing Frasier, except now it's twenty years later, he got Bibi Blazer's dream famous, walked away, and realized he failed Freddy. Literally, the perfect place to pick up almost 20 years later; keep this in mind, David Hyde Pierce killed any chance of the revival they're complaining about; he decided for everyone else that if John Mahoney wasn't there, there was no point. This killed momentum on a lot of the original cast returning. Honestly, it's better for it; it's forced the writers to get more creative. Such a better show then some of these shills are making it out to be, it's the return of the King of Sitcoms, and their over there acting like it's dead on arrival because it's not Sex in the City; what a bunch of dumb takes.""), ('9', 'This is Frasier. It\'s a simple family comedy with a laugh track. Critics seem to have written it off, but it\'s not Frasier that changed, it\'s them. The first 10 minutes of the show were unbelievably awkward, and my guess is many critics stopped watching there and started complaining. The internet has really ruined simple, straightforward family comedy in the last five years. People don\'t watch TV anymore to watch it. They watch to complain about it online. This is pretty much Frasier at his best with a surrounding cast that can\'t keep up. And that\'s exactly what the original Frasier was, too. Ross was never as funny as people remember. Neither was Niles. Neither was his dad (although he was close). The premise of the original Frasier was ""This is Kelsey Grammar out-comedying everyone around him with one-liners to their situations."" It\'s the same thing here. Don\'t listen to critics. Watch this show. It\'s worth it just to see Kelsey Grammar be brilliant one more time.'), ('10', 'I mean it’s a solid start to a series directed by a Cheers co-creator and staring one of the most successful sitcom stars/characters in television history, it’s perfectly fine for what it is, and frankly I’m excited not only for the remaining eight episodes, but for what season 2 will hold in store. I’ve been a diehard Frasier fan for most of my life and frankly the idea for this series is perfect. My mom passed away last month, this was our favorite show together growing up. I got her the Blu-ray’s last year for Christmas, we watched it together before she got diagnosed with lung cancer. I remember her saying her only issue with Frasier is how could he stand at not living closer to Freddy? I genuinely feel like people need to chill out and give season one a chance to breathe. I can already tell it’s gonna be a solid season. As someone else pointed out on here, season one of the Office US did not review well, their trying to find their footing right now, and I want to see them find it to, grateful for a few more seasons with such a loved character like Frasier.'), ('10', ""I don't normally leave reviews here, but I saw the absolutely ludicrous critic scores and actually got a little offended by how their talking about Kelsey Grammer and this new show. It is not perfect, I found the first episode to be pretty rough in places, Freddy is going to take some time to grow on me, I can already see this; not the actor's fault, the way they write him, makes him feel cruel when in fact he's really just embarrassed and defensive, is that ever fun to watch? As for the show itself, I can confidently say that by the end of episode 2 I was really charmed by it all. I felt like enough time had passed that Frasier felt like a character coming back to, I love how their is this whole missing chapter in his life getting teased out in discovery dialog, and visually as he buys something most us wouldn't even be able to afford to rent. I won't go on too long here, I just wanted to say, in my humble opinion, this isn't trying to be True Crime Season 4 here; this is a family-friendly sitcom filmed in front of a live audience like a little play put on once a week, it's cute and very fun, and I feel like the critics come off like a bunch of boring jaded monsters who've forgotten how to enjoy simple things. Reminds me honestly of the critic in Pixar's Ratatouille. Lastly, I will just add that Kelsey Grammer has since the first run of Frasier, become pretty loud about his political leanings, you do have to wonder when you see almost all the negative reviews seem to be coming from the most far-left publications. It's not a good look. Just go watch it for yourself!""), ('10', ""It's really beautiful and warm to see Frasier again, a really adorable and fun character. I could really feel it again.

The original Frasier is one of my all-time favorite shows, so it is nice to see a return to form for Kelsey Grammar. He plays his role perfectly, while the rest of the cast compliments him nicely. I especially enjoyed David, Niles and Daphne's son, as he is a nice fill-in for David Hyde Pierce' absence. I could see this getting significantly better as it goes on.""), ('9', 'What show were these critics watching? It’s literally Frasier but now. The cringe factor seems to be more about protest over it not literally being cast as a direct sequel to season 11 of Frasier. Frankly I’ve watched those 11 seasons to death. I welcome new characters interacting with Frasier, and as much as I miss Martin Crane, not much we can do about that now. I do appreciate them trying to mirror what made the last series so successful. A father and son trying to build a life were they valued being close to each other.

I didn\'t really feel very connected to the main protagonist or his companions by the end. There certainly isn\'t too much depth to the characters. However, there are enough obstacles for the team to overcome, such as family issues and self-confidence, which prevent some ""Gary Stu"" character. The EEAAO cast being present feels forced.

This is unfortunate since they\'re some of the strongest actors in the cast. Quan talks a bit about the broken system of Hollywood for Chinese Americans, and it\'s one of the few conversations about race that actually land within the series; not focusing on some strawman racist, but a real, lived experience within the business and culture of Hollywood. Outside of this you\'re left with a mediocre but enjoyable fantasy story, with a bit of coming-of-age drama. It\'s fun and the fight scenes are well choreographed. I did feel drawn to watch the next episode when one finished, just to see how the story turned out. This will definitely be more popular in a younger audience.

I was happy about the season finale, not because there was anything in the episode that I was looking forward to, but because I was happy that I wouldn't have to suffer through the show after the season ended. Though the last 15 minutes of the finale were actually enjoyable because of some characters from the original series showing up. As for this one, most of the characters were not just not interesting, but annoyingly stupid and not worth watching. Timothy Olyphant still did a great job playing Raylan Givens, but the storyline didn't set him up for success and he seemed a complete misfit in an otherwise terrible show. Many of the actions he took, or didn't take, were not true to his original character. It was a cool touch to see his real life daughter play his daughter in the show, but from a story perspective it was rather irrelevant. And while Boyd Holbrook is a very good actor and it's fun to see him in many roles, the main villain character was not intelligent and so wasn't justice to Holbrook either. I'd say the same for many of the other good actors in the show who unfortunately had to play very weak characters. The witty dialogue, richness of the characters and good storylines that made the original Justified so awesome were all missing in this reboot.

They tried to take a formula that worked over 40 years ago and make it work now. At a time where too much has changed since. It doesn't translate. They've tried to force the Brooks formula into a new one and new actors. Actors who, while funny, don't fit the formula.

If you’re set on watching this show, my advice: the minute an episode ends and you find yourself thinking, “Huh, that didn’t make me laugh even once”…just stop watching there. The sketches start off charming and funny enough (if a bit underwhelming) and get progressively less funny as the show goes on. I suspect the editors realized this and deliberately loaded all of the most successful sketches into the first few episodes hoping that they’d have already gotten you hooked by the time it starts deteriorating. It doesn’t get better once it drops off. Just save yourself the headache and quit while you’re ahead. Also if you’re like me and have limited patience for Nick Kroll’s whole shtick, you might just want to just skip this show entirely.

She's a new recruit to the special secret ops group and her mission is to befriend the daughter of a wealthy funder for terrorists. Her training and subsequent involvement forms the crux of the story with the other 2 women confronting the political and logistical consequences. Creator Taylor Sheridan has placed the emphasis on female characters with their personal relationships adding an emotional connection, but the thrust is really about the covert ops. There are a few moments of tough physical encounters to maintain the action adjective, but the focus is on the mental challenges these characters face, so there's lots of Sheridan's spicy chatter punctuated by spurts of violence."")}"

That is all you need to know to keep you from watching it.'), ('1', ""Updated: Out of 7 episodes so far, only the 5th, is well done and interesting. The rest being predictable and preaching candy wrapped in great actors names, is mostly very uneven and wasted opportunity. First episode is maybe still ok as an introduction, second has great ideas there, but somehow the end us wasted opportunity (underwhelming and predictable). Third one instead of showing destruction of Miami is wasted on other stuff (don't want to spoil it), the ending is so disgustingly sugary that it offends intelligence of viewers. Some people would stop watching the series here. Fourth episode is wasted for clumsy rehearsal of some white house procedural drama, flashy but pretty empty and again predictable. Only the 5th one has something to say and show. Happens in India, shows the heatwave effects (so called wetbulb effect) and how horrible is for average human beings. And first time in the series really shows what it means for majority of the people in the world - working class, poor from outiside developed countries. So far we could think that climate change only touches lifes of middle class from the West, and it's really more of the question if you can buy more comfortable mode of survivial. Till that episode it doesn't include working class and poor (even poor from US and Europe) as if they would not exist or they would be a mere background like wild animals going to extinct. 5th episode is well made, has finally flavor of something authentic (people speaking and showing their feeling in their mother language - still it's being reduced because apparently American viewers cannot read subtitles) and shows mortal danger and helplessness of climate changes. That could be shown in Miami episode, but choose to go for some moral arguments and preaching. In India we have at least a glimpse of how mortifying and real the future might be. If antalogu would keep 5th episode formula would get 9 stars, but for all the too obvious preachiness, wasted ideas and focusing on middle class sanitized troubles, it get generous 3 stars. Can only hope that the rest of episodes are different. Updated: After watching now 7 episodes - it's pretty obvious that for creators the only people worth making series about are the ones from rich West, and global South is just some non-existent background, mentioned briefly only on radio/news. Even animals are getting more attention than real people living in India, Bangladesh, African countries etc. Dropping my to 1 - there is literally one episode happening in Global South. Shame.""), ('0', 'Remember when the tone-deaf celebrities banded together to \'inspire\' us by singing Imagine?

I had such high hopes given the quality of the actors that signed up for this. Perhaps they had high hopes too but it fails at every level. The producers had a golden opportunity to show how life of various levels of society would be affected by climate change and thy failed miserably. Each episode is relatively disconnected from the prior one although some are somewhat linked. Each one seems worse than the other. I used to like Forrest Whitaker but not in this. He seems absolutely amateurish. Perhaps you can ""credit"" the stilted, not credible dialogue, but notwithstanding that, the recitation of his lines, his gestures and his expressions are high school level at best. It is literally painful to watch.. We may struggle through the final episode with John Snow for giggles.'), ('5', 'Every time I saw a big name actor in this show, I thought about how big their house must be, how many houses they must own, and how many flights on a private jet they must have taken to be part of this show. One of my family members noticed that all of the characters live rich, comfortable lives. We see the results of climate change as they watch TV. It is as of the people making this show have no concept of struggle except as it might apply to watching other people. And ultimately show pins the fate of mankind rests on all our shoulders, even though some shoulders bear much, much more responsibility than others. The show itself looks good and in its own way, shows us the predicted effects of climate change. You can see the production value and the talent of the enormous cast of characters. The writing is sometimes clever. After animals like tigers are extinct, kids believe they’ve always been extinct. Sometimes the writing is blunt force trauma. A cynical business man boldly claims that can profit from climate change because he will be dead before the worst of it. Some of it is just too forcefully poetic to enjoy a rewatch. We need more scenes to show what is happening on the ground. Let us see heat stroke, drought, flooding, and fires and not clean offices and well dressed models. I want to see this show get its hands dirty,')}"
