Oppenheimer,"Jul 21, 2023",3 h,88,8.7,"{('7', ""Yeah, people are gonna hate me a little, I don't think Oppenheimer is the greatest film to ever be made but it is interesting to watch, perhaps it is a bit too long and doesn't contain any action in terms of showing the actual consequences visually, it's very Dramatic and I get it. I expected the film to focus on Oppenheimer which it did and also the consequences of the H-bomb on Japan. It uses a lot of visual imagery but it takes its time. Look I can watch a film with just talking and no action, give 12 Angry Men a try, that was great. But this film just drags, for 3 hours and it makes the resolution of it all not as impactful. Not to mention the number of cuts that are in this film, everything is mostly in order, but ultimately it feels disjointed. I'm going to give Oppenhiemer a 7/10, it's not a great film, it's just a highly interesting one, with some scenes that are not important plot.""), ('5', ""It gets 4 for the acting which is impeccable (if misguided by the direction) but the movies itself is dreadfully boring. They took everything of interest about the making of the atomic bomb, including the devastating impacts on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and focussed instead on political intrigue which I couldn't care less about. Such a missed opportunity to make something genuinely thoughtful and moving about the horrors of nuclear weapons and a crisis of conscience. Also reminiscent of the 1980s in terms of its treatment of female characters, which are either crazy or long suffering. Very reductive.""), ('4', 'Total snoozefest! Cinematography and performances should be given credit here but OH MY GOD, so freakin’ boring!! Three, long, draggy hours of absolutely nothing but people standing around talking!'), ('3', 'Three hours of star cast with a completely confusing, boring plot. Somehow edited together with constant time jumps. Exciting background music constantly announces a finale that never comes. For me, this was one of the worst filmed biographies I have seen. After Dunkirk and Tenet, the next completely messed up Nolan film.'), ('9', 'Great movie'), ('10', 'one of the best movie of this decade'), ('8', 'Long movie. Many digressions. Good cinematography. Good acting. Moral quandaries not exactly as I remember them, but reasonably presented. Good representation of gov\'t hacks and Los Alamos. Good representation of commitment and loyalty (or lack thereof). All in all, we\'d say this movie: ""...is well worth watching. So get your popcorn and sit down and enjoy a crucial piece of history.""'), ('2', ""It's basically 3 continuous hours of a whole chorus of characters talking and talking, almost always, in riddles. In typical Nolan fashion, everything is convoluted and juxtaposed into a hardly endurable spectacle. At a moment, your brain is trying to decipher the last dialogue, then the fast paced editing show another set of actors riddling again.""), ('9', ""Oppenheimer is the culmination of Nolan's work and as a part of the 'Barbenheimer' phenomenon, both are 'serious works', done by younger auteurs at the top of their game. Nolan used all the tricks that he learned in the Dark Knight trilogy and his other flicks, and applied it to a bio-pic. The end result is a tour de force, and while it is not his best work (The Dark Knight is still his best), it is a more palatable work for award consideration. It will dominate the Awards this upcoming season for sure and might win him a Best Picture / Best Director combo at the Oscars.""), ('10', ""One of the best film in the history, this is the best thing I've ever done Kristofer Nolan""), ('10', '""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds."" How do I even begin to describe this movie. Why I missed it in the theaters is a mystery to me as well but man, Christopher Nolan is the single most greatest director of all time and I\'m not going to take that back. Going into this I was scared I would get bored but man from the first minute I was hooked all the way to the end. Cillian Murphy deserves an Oscar for his performance as Dr J Robert Oppenheimer. As well as Robert Downey Jr does an absolutely amazing performance as Lewis Strauss. The whole cast is absolutely amazing and the amount of detail put into this is crazy and the large ensemble is too great. Florence Pugh is one of the stars as well along with Emily Blunt. There are so much amazing things about this movie but what I love the most is the character development of Oppenheimer which is mind blowing followed by an incredible script by Nolan himself. The foreshadowing in this thing is crazy as well, the full circle moments are mind blowing as well. And of course the explosion itself doesn\'t disappoint at all, it\'s big, it\'s large and loud. Christopher Nolan is absolutely crazy for this and that\'s what makes me love him even more. The visuals as well are incredible and packed with that beautiful and suspenseful soundtrack by Ludwig Gorranson that I will listen on repeat from now. There are so much more things that I want to say that I can\'t describe in words, end of review, Christopher Nolan is 100% the greatest human being to ever make a film. Overall, after watching this I do need that JFK movie.

With the overlong first and third the film feels laborious. The story itself feels more like something PBS would cover in a 45 minute biopic than a 3 hour IMAX slog.'), ('7', 'Its alright.'), ('8', 'Good enough movie. One of Christopher Nolan’s mid film I will say as a causal fan of Christopher Nolan (my favorite being interstellar) a 3 hour epic of the true story of Dr. Oppenheimer and the atomic bomb. If you’re into history this movie has enough there for you, but it does fall somewhat flat at what it’s trying to do and the structure of the story is clunky and convoluted, the worst part about the movie for me. If your a film buff like myself there’s something there for you but nothing too groundbreaking other than a special effects masterclass. I did find myself somewhat dissatisfied with what I was expecting but if you go in with an open mind and not too many expectations you should enjoy it. It’s on 4k now, check it out. 7.8/10'), ('10', ""Christopher Nolan was able to prove again that he is the best director of the century. Oppenheimer will be Nolan's best work.""), ('5', '(Mauro Lanari) Nolan plunderes humanistic and scientific disciplines to expose stories from the most bizarre perspectives on time: neuropsychopathology, Bergsonian subjectivism, thermodynamics and this time the Parmenidean aspect of Einstein\'s cosmology. The biopic would also be about the protagonists of QM, but the POV is the one hypothesized by special relativity. This explains the mistreated Fermi and the elite of quantum physics barely glimpsed in favor of the insistent comparison with the theory developed in 1905 by the Ulm physicist: not only Einstein but Thorne who is once again thanked in the credits and Oppenheimer himself with his first publication on black holes. The conception of time according to the Nobel Prize winner coincides with that of the Greek philosopher: ""the distinction between past, present, and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion"" [variant: ""it is only an illusion, however tenacious""]. Becoming is frozen in an eternal compresence of the 3 temporal extensions and the first act of the film is structured on the basis of such idea. Admitting its veracity, is it possible to know what it entails on a practical level? Could the principle of ethical responsibility fail? Einstein\'s answer is that everyone would act driven not by a non-existent free will but by their own predetermined nature, so much so that the sentence reported is an excerpt from his letter sent to the Besso family for Michele\'s death, while ataraxia and apatheia humorally disappear when it comes to taking care of the paranoid Gödel or drafting the Manifesto with Russell which was followed by the founding of Pugwash. Thus, however, the premise of the 2nd act of the film vanishes, the high school essay on the relationship between science and conscience, a question that Kubrick was able to solve with an ellipsis. Instead Nolan finds himself forced to fall back on linear diegesis by re-embracing Newtonian physics: the end of the daring experimentation and the beginning of the Hollywood blockbuster, the phase for the (successful) attempt to recover the budget starts. Then there is the 3rd act, a courtroom drama where bad and good politics (JFK) clash with Einstein on the right side. Proudhon\'s phrase attributed to Marx? A trifle. The reaction to the Trinity test of the Japanese theologian Kitamori that in 1946 devastated the Trinitarian dogmatics? For more experienced and knowledgeable filmmakers.'), ('5', 'Over hyped, I expected more from the storyline, it got kinda boring, but a fantastic cast, and nice cinematography.'), ('1', 'SO BORING! too much !! Too long and what is the point of that movie ???? Really not a good moment for me…'), ('8', ""Due to its nature, Oppenheimer may not become one of Nolan's best films. Its slow-burn storytelling and relatively less action might play a role in that. Nevertheless, the tale it tells focuses on history's most crucial invention that jeopardizes our existence. Nolan crafts a narrative by dividing the story into three parts, keeping the excitement alive. The film is an enthralling journey that includes notable figures like Einstein and Enrico Fermi. Although not entirely factual, the film's message, particularly conveyed through President Harry Truman, illustrates what Nolan intends to portray. Thank you, Nolan."")}"
Barbie,"Jul 21, 2023",1 h 54 m,80,5.2,"{('3', 'A sloppily written hypocritical mess.'), ('8', 'While the plot was a little thin I think this movie is still a ton of fun and has great directing, set design, costume design and all around good to great performances. Ken steals the show and Margot Robbie is a wonderful Barbie.'), ('6', ""In my opinion, Barbie is a fun and happy movie that children can watch with their families, but the problem is that the point of this movie is not the Barbie doll.

I really enjoyed this. You have to accept that there is no story, it’s just a series of events tied to a moralistic message, but it’s fun and lighthearted and there’s quite a lot of well written jokes and fun musical scenes. The only gripe I have is that they didn’t seem to know what to do with the ending, it turns into a weird pseudo Matrix Reloaded where the Architect/maker uses word salad in a failed attempt to clarify the meaning of…. Whatever… Other than that we loved it. I can see why this gets mixed reviews though, for some people they may feel exposed or roasted by the comedy and not everyone has a sense of humour about them selves. In that case it’s probably a film aimed AT them, not FOR them.'), ('7', 'A hilarious spectacle of cinema, I was giggling throughout! Was hoping for more action scenes from my boy Ryan ""Drive"" Gosling but it\'s not that type of movie. I was elated to see all the young girls dressed in pink at my showing!'), ('1', ""Toxic femininity versus toxic masculinity. Who lost? Viewer. In short, I'm furious. If it’s detailed, I’ll tell you now, trying to avoid spoilers. Unfortunately, I can’t tell you the plot. So let's move straight to the film's shortcomings, of which I found exactly seven.First. Throughout the film, director Greta Gerwig asks questions and raises issues. She says that the real world is one of men in power and women only playing a secondary role. In Barbieland it's the other way around. However, the plot “turn of the arrow” teaches neither one nor the other anything! The picture shows how terrible it is to live under patriarchy, but demonstrates that matriarchy is the same horror, but in reverse. According to Gerwig, a world where everyone is happy is impossible.Second. At the beginning we see that Barbie is a whole universe where there are separate dolls for each race and profession. But then from the lips of one heroine we hear that in fact, Barbie introduces impossible ideals into the minds of children. As a solution, we are offered a “regular Barbie” without a profession, so that she can decide for herself what to become - but why then are all the other dolls needed, since they are so bad? Does this mean the world doesn't need a Wheelchair Barbie or an Astronaut Barbie?Third. Nobody needs Ken. At the beginning, Gosling's character is tormented by unrequited love for Barbie. He tries to get away from the lack of attention through denial and creepy attempts to introduce patriarchy into Barbieland. But in fact, he just wants to live peacefully with Barbie and receive her attention. Instead, the Kens are taken away from their power and driven back under the bunk, not allowed to play any role in the life of Barbie society. I honestly feel sorry for Ken-Gosling.Fourth. During the course of the film, we are shown that Barbies are happy to be second! They are ready to wear short skirts and carry Kenam beer. Their opinion is changed only by a lecture about how bad it is to be under the heel of men. Why was it necessary to show that Barbie herself is cool to be at her beck and call? And why deprive them of such luxury if it’s normal for them? Gerwig, how do we understand this?Fifth. As the film progresses, nothing in the world changes. Barbie has no influence on real women, Mattel management is made up of men who act like clowns. By the way, there is only one adequate man in the film, and no, it’s not Ken. Then why was all this?Sixth. The film suddenly shows that 1) being pregnant is terrible and 2) being a man who does not live up to masculine ideals is terrible. The first is shown through a pregnant doll, from which everyone stays away for some reason throughout the film. The second is through Michael Cera's character, who doesn't like the Kens' ideas or the Barbie ideas. He just lives on his own and wants to get into the real world, because there is no place for him in Barbieland. Question: WHY does the film show such things?And seventh. When given new opportunities, what is the first thing Barbie does? No, he doesn’t go to defend women’s rights, he doesn’t look for his destiny, but he goes to the gynecologist! The epic of feminism does not give women new rights; instead, the doll acquires new biological characteristics. That's all the film wanted to tell us.I hope at least some of you enjoyed reading this. I'll go see something good, but I forbid you to spend money on Barbie. Better buy a book. Or a glass of coffee.""), ('4', ""It's a big no. Ultra feministic movie about nothing. They tried to fit a lot of ideas in one movie but at the result was bad. It's not worth watching at all""), ('1', ""This movie is contradictory and hypocrite. It will not be remembered in 1 year. It's only bad femnisim propaganda. Don't get me wrong, I have nothing agains feminism but the ideas and they way is presented here make 0 sense. This kind of bullsh**t and they way is presented will do no good to feminism. Apart from that the movie is overall stupid and boring.""), ('10', 'Barbie is a splendid film with storytelling made to trick its audience while also providing enough color and humor for a satirical adventure.'), ('4', ""Not really sure why I stuck it out to the end, perhaps the Hollywood star power? The interesting aesthetic? Whatever the reason its now time I won't recoup. The writing was bad, the messaging was worse and sadly enough it just wasn't that fun to watch. If only Hollywood could just do something right for a change!""), ('9', 'I am a straight male, 41 years old and i am not a feminist. i watched the barbie movie today and i dont understand all the critics. The movie isnt serious at all and is not man hating. I actually enjoyed it. And yes it is as a movie way better than Oppenheimer.'), ('0', 'Men are predators, women are victims. I got it. Expected a real movie'), ('6', ""I don't know. First I want to say that Margot Robbie and Ryan Gossling did a great job and that's the main pro here. The main con here is the plot. This movie is so so confusing. I mean, at the beginning I understand the story, but as the end comes by, I really have no idea what's going on. Confusing. Really confusing.""), ('9', 'I was warned, that the movie is feministic, so I didnt expect much. But the movie was a big surprise: Rist the world they created is incredibile: so many hints to the barbie world and all made sense. The humour was the best surprise, I laughed so often and some gags were great. The story of course isnt incredible, but I like some aspects of it. Margot Robbie and Ryan Goslings performance were top. So the only reason for 9 and not 10 is feminism as written above. They could have save this problem, if they focus more on the theme respect in the end, they were so close...'), ('7', 'while not the profound protest against patriarchy some like to paint it as, Barbie did put a reasonable effort into promoting feminism and is also for the most part an entertaining watch.'), ('7', 'Barbie is one of the most iconic toys of all time! It genuinely baffled me that it took this long for there to be a Barbie film. Barbie isn\'t my thing, so I wasn\'t interested in watching this. It wasn\'t until the first trailer came out and the global internet cultural phenomenon ""Barbenheimer"", the release of Barbie and Oppenheimer on the same day, that my interest was piqued. So is life plastic, it\'s fantastic? Or is it just Ken? Firstly, casting Margot Robbie as Stereotypical Barbie was perfect! She is incredibly charming and earnest in the role. She conveys a naive yet caring nature to her character while being very funny at times. Ryan Gosling as Beach Ken is also perfect casting! He is the greatest highlight with his hilarious physical performance. Every time he is on screen, he brings the laughs. Ryan also conveys a vulnerability to Ken which is surprising. Margot and Ryan have a fun chemistry together! This film has a huge cast with many playing other variations of Barbie and Ken. They are all good in their limited screen time but the stand out is Michael Cera who plays Ken\'s best buddy Allan. I just love how different he is from the others and how he manages to be so lovable in his limited screen time. From the first 30 minutes, you will notice the amazing costumes and set designs. Barbieland itself looks like a Barbie toy set brought to life. The massive amount of pink covering the world, the plastic look of all the accessories, houses and cars. Every Barbie and Kens clearly had a lot of thought put into their costumes because no Barbie and Ken look the same. Every costume manages to reflect the type of Barbie and Ken they are. The music score is great and the use of vocal songs was utilized effectively. Special mention to ""I\'m Just Ken"" sung by Ryan Gosling! Some great dance scenes are entertaining to watch with their fun choreography. It is a comedy at heart and there are quite some funny jokes and moments with a surprising amount of great adult jokes. I also love how they poke fun at Mattel and even Barbie as a brand which is a bold move. Despite that, some strong emotional moments with one near the end can definitely tug at the heartstrings. However, the movie does suffer from some poor execution of certain elements. There is the Barbieland stuff which is enjoyable but the real-world stuff is just not that fun. It is stated early on that Barbie\'s thoughts are being influenced by someone playing with Barbies in the real world. How does the connection work? how much of Barbie\'s thought is her own? None of these things are explored, leaving many questions. On that note, certain characters will change very quickly without much build-up to these changes. Due to this, we don\'t get a true understanding of Barbie as a character, she changes because the film needs some kind of character development. There is also a mother and daughter character in the real world who Barbie meets. One of them is depressed and there is a rift between them but the film doesn\'t bother to explore the reason for any of that. We also meet Will Ferrell who plays the CEO of Mattel and he is just inconsequential to the story but takes a lot of screen time. He is also over-the-top and silly. I was hoping for a contrast between the cartoony Barbieland and the real world. However, characters in the real world act just as cartoony and ridiculous as those in Barbie Land. It makes the real-world scenes less impactful when it should have been a big moment in the film. The film is also incredibly preachy about its feminist message that it can be exhausting. Also, the 3rd act has a silly resolution that feels contradictory to the feminist nature of this film. Additionally, every male character in this film are idiotic baby and if that gets under your skin, then this movie is not for you. Overall, Barbie is a good fun time. I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed it. This film is not going to appeal to everyone with its themes and message. Nevertheless, the movie is just plain entertaining and honestly, it is ""Kenough"" for me!'), ('0', 'This movie provides a very negative and distorted view of the male mindset and portrays this to women as the world we live in. Equality and empowerment is NOT a zero-sum game; by treating it so this movie basks in the same type of hypocritical stereotyping it feigns to fight against, thus the makers of this movie are no better than the chauvinists they take aim at all movie long. Heavy on the preaching, inaccurate on the portrayal of men, and light on story. Awful and hateful movie.'), ('5', 'I guess this chick flick was successful at capturing that fantasy imagery, but WOW talk about one big gaslighting session! So woke and clearly told from the mind of a feminist. Unfortunately this was just as stupid and dumb as I thought it would be.')}"

Maybe, like many other modern audiences, my attention span has been reduced to that of a fish because of Youtube and social media.

The story starts off well but then, as others have pointed out, becomes too focussed on 'the key.' 'The key this,' 'the key that.' I though this was going to be a segment.

In my opinion, though, it may be a little step behind Fallout, which is my favourite recent MI movie. Seriously, damn this film hits, now granted there are a few problems, some may notice that there are silent action scenes in here, and while I would prefer the music to represent what's going on in the film, they chose to keep some scenes completely silent of music for extended periods. What is interesting is that even when there are potential flaws in this film, my eyes are glued to the screen and the true reason why I'm giving it an 8/10 is because, well it is the first part of two films and the music score isn't as powerful as it was in Fallout. But anyway, The big question is, should you watch this? It is a definite YES, but watch it as late as you can so you don't have to wait so long for Part 2. Finally, is it just me or have MI movies predicted a somewhat truth to things that are happening or have happened in the past few years? Weird, anyway I look forward to Part 2, and if that film is better than this, I will raise this by a point.

This movie’s compelling and timely plot and well written script have become extremely rare qualities in film in this age of industry desperation, abuse, greed and partisan political rhetoric. Dead Reckoning: Part One accurately portrays the noble qualities of humanity in juxtaposition with its selfish chaos while simultaneously presenting the very real and rising threat to our entire race in the form of an extremely advanced and, perhaps, unbeatable opponent: Artificial Intelligence. Lorne Balfe, whose Hollywood credits are endless, delivers a stunning musical score. Perfection does exist in cinema, and many Hollywood titles achieve it. Dead Reckoning comes strikingly close, with clear and concise dialogue, Hollywood’s greatest acting talents, and exceptional cinematography from Fraser Taggart. Direction here is astute and timely; moving the plot along briskly and keeping the viewer engaged and concerned. Some pacing mistakes are made as well as hiccups in believability and realism. Overall, Dead Reckoning: Part One continues the tradition of premiere spy thriller excellence in the Mission Impossible franchise. The little known truth about the Universe, is that its qualities are that of generosity and patience. Our planet has always nurtured life, offering a boundless wealth of sustenance and nutrition. As children of Earth, mankind’s nature is also one of giving and forgiving; a fact that so many millions (especially those in power) refuse to acknowledge; deciding to, instead, consume, destroy and exploit for personal gain.

As for you Kathleen, it is clear that you have no idea what you are doing, I still wonder why George even gave his beloved franchises to Disney in the first place, only to be mistreated.

It can be super over the top, but Indiana Jones' movies have always been like that, and it's part of it, it doesn't take itself too seriously and neither should we, it's a cool and entertaining movie. I am a bit contrary to most Indy fans out there, I really like Crystal Skull and dislike Temple of Doom, I know I'll get hate for saying this, but it's just so you know where I stand when it comes to this franchise. Helena (Phoebe Waller-Bridge) can be annoying at first, but she manages to become likable as the movie progress.

It pains me to even acknowledge that this is the last film in this series. Say it isn’t so, James Gunn! He wrote and directed the film. At the beginning of the film, we see the lights turn off in Quill’s bedroom, illustrating that James Gunn is putting this trilogy to bed. But surely, Marvel won’t really retire this hugely successful part of the MCU, right??? Here’s how the studio describes this final installment: In Marvel Studios “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3” our beloved band of misfits are looking a bit different these days. Peter Quill, still reeling from the loss of Gamora, must rally his team around him to defend the universe along with protecting one of their own. A mission that, if not completed successfully, could quite possibly lead to the end of the Guardians as we know them. THINGS I LIKED: The fantastic cast includes our fan favorites: Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, Karen Gillan, Pom Kementieff, Vin Diesel, Bradley Cooper, Sean Gunn, Chukwudi Iwuji, Will Poulter, Sylvester Stallone, Elizabeth Debicki, and more! The beginning of the movie starts on a sad, serious note, something I wasn’t expecting. Lots of creative set pieces. Gunn does a great job blending tense action scenes with humor and heart. We get to find out Rocket Raccoon’s origin story. Awwww… It is said that many of the songs in the film are diegetic, which means the characters can hear the music. The song that opens and closes the trilogy is “Come and Get Your Love” by Redbone. Sweet. Keep watching during the rolling credits at the end of the movie for another cute scene that references Kevin Bacon. As always, the soundtrack is terrific. The rest of the music by John Murphy was excellent. The story is extremely emotional. You WILL cry. We get a few short cameo performances from a few past characters. Yay! No spoilers! I always love the slow-motion action sequences. So entertaining. THINGS I DIDN’T LIKE: The movie definitely assumes that you already know and love the characters, and understand how the Guardians’ universe works. If you haven’t seen any of the Guardians movies, you should absolutely not start with this one. Start from the beginning. Too many of the costumes and sets look like costumes and sets: more design than magic. In fact, this movie sets a new record for the most prosthetics (23,000) used on over 1000 actors. I wish the voice of Cosmo, the Spacedog, were different. It sounds too much like Mantis’ character. The female voice by Maria Bakalova was used to pay tribute to Laika, the Russian dog who was one of the first animals in space. There are way too many characters to keep track of in this final installment. So much yelling. The movie is messy with tonal changes. There are a lot of flashbacks that might confuse the timeline for some viewers. Ultimately, I wanted more. Because I’m such a fan of the franchise, I really wanted to be blown away but wasn’t.

It felt like a Tarantino movie but without the violent climax. The only time I felt like walking out is when Brendan Fraser shows up. He and the actor who plays the prosecutor are a huge contrast to De Niro\'s acting. Sorry, but it\'s true. They show up late in the movie and change the whole atmosphere to a Netflixy vibe. By that point I was like ""alright, I\'m done"". But I stayed. Also, halfway through it seems that DiCaprio starts playing a different character. I understood what the movie was supposed to be about in the last 10 minutes or so. It\'s supposed to be about human character and the lows that we can go to that may just be too low. But it doesn\'t do that well. It doesn\'t focus on the angst and the distress of the characters: just showing coffins and corpses is not doing that. That scene in the end is the one scene that feels close to it. But that scene alone doesn\'t pay off, even though it ties the movie together. I would say it\'s a good movie, I guess. It\'s worth watching simply because it\'s Scorcese and DiCaprio and De Niro. Really. It\'s also filled with some political stuff that feels a little forced in. Like they\'re trying to force an angle.

Scorcese’s choice to focus the story on the “tortured soul” of a dimwitted man and his manipulative genocidal uncle is a destructive waste of time and possibilities. I wonder - what could have this film been with one Indigenous person involved in a leading creative role? There is something much more profound rumbling beneath this Hollywood interpretation of history. Lily Gladstone and every Indigenous actor in this film are stones washing ashore in a storm. They shine, and make the most when given sips of air to breath, offering respite from torture with grace, humility, edge, and spirit. Gladstone’s undoubtedly complex, yet unrealized character Molly is still relegated to a filmmaker afterthought. The Osage people are treated as dogs, poisoned, shot, and do basically nothing to look into how their people are dying. How is this entertainment or helpful to ending the cycle of colonization and stigmatization of Indigenous people as victims? I understand the Osage people hope it is helpful to their people and gets the story out, but, I just don't know. You can tell there is something off when filmmakers feel the need to open their film with a personal disclaimer about how much they wanted to make a movie, and then close it with themselves. Why bookend yourself? How positively “elite” critics have received this film is unsurprising. It's just not that good of a film. As we all know, it is long, yet flaccidly paced. Not a good combo.

There is really good character development around the main cast, though most of the side characters tended to blend together; no Michael Peña from Ant-Man here, but that is fine, it should be about Creed and his family, after all. They did pretty good with Drago and left me wanting a spin-off and seeing him become champion! I wouldn't be against a Rocky Cinematic Universe.

It has its lows and its over-the-top entries but for the most part, this series has been mostly hits than misses. Creed was a spinoff and I never expected to enjoy it so immensely. I loved Creed 1 and Creed 2 which is why I was hoping for a hat trick with Creed 3. There was some worry as this is the first entry without Rocky. it was also Michael B. Jordan's directorial debut with him starring as Creed and directing. So does it succeed or is this a miss? Firstly, Michael did a great job in his directorial debut. He pushes the Creed movies out of Rocky's shadow and gives it more grit. The fights feel more visceral and flashy with some clear anime-inspired influence. He uses a lot of slow-mo which leads to some nice-looking shots. I also think the boxing intro and montage were also really well shot as well. He also does something interesting in the final fight that involves silence which gave it a new feel. The soundtrack was awesome and the cinematography is great. He also gives darker qualities to the story with the backstory and personal connection with the antagonist Damian (Jonathan Majors). On that note, Jonathan Majors is terrific as the antagonist. I love his performance, with the subtle awkwardness and slightly pained expression in the first half. Then in the second half, we get to see Jonathan give an arrogant, menacing performance when he goes full bad guy. I also enjoyed how sympathetic he is as a character as well. You understand why Adonis would help him. Additionally, Michael continues to give a great performance as Adonis Creed with the amount of emotional moments in this film. There is great chemistry between Michael and Jonathan which made the friendship between their characters feel believable. Tessa returns as Bianca and she is good in her small role in this film as well. However, I do have some issues with this film. The first half focuses on building up the characters and eventual conflict which is fine. The second half is incredibly rushed though with clearly many cuts made towards it. We don't get a great sense of how much time passed so it is baffling to suddenly see Damian successful so quickly. It would've helped to have seen Damian in more fights. We could have seen him growing more and more successful while also seeing how much of a threat he is. Unfortunately, this movie doesn't have a lot of boxing fights and enough build-up in the second half. It is also weird how quickly Damian's personality changes. Another issue is the lack of inner conflict for Adonis. We see him feeling guilty about what happened to Damian but that's mostly it. For example, we don't see his doubt about retiring or concern about his daughter and wife. On that note, there is a daughter subplot introduced in this film that went nowhere. Felt very pointless. Overall, Creed III is another good entry in this franchise. It's an impressive directorial debut from Michael and I look forward to future work from him, Creed or otherwise. Even without Rocky, this franchise seems to be doing well standing on its own feet. I'm not sure what direction Creed 4 can go in but if it is of a similar quality to previous entries, then I will 100% be there to watch!""), ('8', ""The drama has some low moments, but visually it's the more interesting film in the saga""), ('6', 'ok thats it for the creed franchise - its done well so leave it at that yeah'), ('7', 'Possibly has the weakest boxing scenes of any of the Creed or even the Rocky movies.

The film's core story felt similar to Rocky V but done in the right way; solid performances, great cinematography, well-paced editing, and clear directionality to the narrative. The film charts into more familiar and predictable territory near the half way marker where character, unfortunately, take a turn into cliche stereotypes and lose a bit of humanity.

It’s fun to hang out in Adonis Creed’s gorgeous house. I love that the movie features some of the pageantry in boxing when both boxers parade into the arena with their music and entourage before the big fight. That’s always my favorite part of boxing matches. One of my sons was a boxer for a short time. My husband thinks boxing is the coolest sport ever. I love training montages, except I felt like such a slug watching it while sitting on my butt and eating while watching. I definitely need to work out harder. Ha ha Hard-hitting soundtrack! I’m always amazed at how they film boxing scenes to make them look so real. I thought the scenes that just showed the two of them, alone, in a ring were especially effective and offered the perspective of how personal the fight was for the two men. Many of the famous boxing announcers and TV personalities offer cameo performances. I always get a kick out of that because it lends credibility to the scenes as if they’re in real-life. THINGS I DIDN’T LIKE: Sylvester Stallone does not appear in this sequel, which is a shame. He crafted the Rocky character and franchise, but was, sadly, left out of this new addition. That seems super disrespectful to ole Sly, as well as a disappointment to many fans. He hasn’t hidden his frustration about being shut down by Ryan Coogler and Irwin Winkler, saying he’ll never watch this movie. What’s really missing in this sequel is the heart and soul that Rocky always gave us. I assume we’re going to see Bianca competing in the ring one of these days, eh? Act 3 feels very rushed compared to the first two acts. For example, we see Dane call out Adonis in a show, and then, suddenly, they’re training and in the ring. There’s no conversation between Adonis and his wife who, surely, would have a strong opinion about his fighting again after so many physical dangers to his battered body. We see her hugging him as he enters the ring, clearly supporting him in his decision to fight again. It just felt like a huge jump in time and story. Like all of the movies in the Rocky and Creed universe, this film is extremely predictable. TIPS FOR PARENTS: Sign language and Spanish are spoken with subtitles. Lots of fighting action in and outside of the boxing ring. Talk of jail time. A girl gets in trouble at school for punching another student.

Also, the movie suffers a little bit to transition between acts; it always feels a little abrupt. Having said that, the rest of the film is effective. The main plus is the antagonist; Jonathan Majors portrays one of the rocky/creed series' most nuanced and engaging antagonists. Outside of him, the battle sequences are superb, the character development is outstanding, and the training montages are strong. Where Michael B. Jordan's style really shines are the combat sequences."")}"

Keep watching during the closing credits for another scene that leads perfectly into Season 2 of Loki.

The world-building is inventive and interesting. It cracked me up when Dr. Hank Pym used his handy-dandy enlarger to get a large pizza when he only paid for a small one. ha ha If you can never get enough of the Star Wars cantina scenes, you’ll get a kick out of what’s offered here. Fun fact #1: The movie was filmed in Georgia (USA), London (England), and Turkey. Lots of action sequences. Kang the Conquerer is a fascinating character that we’ll get to learn more about in future MCU films. Jonathan Majors does an excellent job introducing us to this powerful foe. Audiences are loving the exploration of the multiverse that Marvel is taking us into. There are some amusing running gags that kept me entertained. I used to love Baskin Robbins when I was a little girl. ha ha The reference and Scott-employee cameo were cute. THINGS I DIDN’T LIKE: As much as I like Evangeline Lilly (and I do!), I didn’t like her with short hair. Kathryn Newton replaced the younger Cassie Lang.

In theological terms: eschatology as soteriology. Instead, ""in the cinematographic imagination, as in the common one, the word \'apocalypse\' evokes more destruction than healing, more catastrophe than salvation, so that the latter assumes, for the most part, the aspect of pure escape.

The movie’s marketing made it feel like the film was going to lean heavier into the horror aspect rather than the family (which the book focuses on), but strangely censors itself to avoid gore or anything that would leave the viewer uneasy. Overall, the film felt rushed, and the decisions felt forced. Not much left for discussion which was a strong point of the book. It’s strange, because this really shouldn’t have been hard to adapt to film. I wouldn’t say the book was amazing, but the movie is certainly a downgrade.'), ('8', 'If you know the plot before watching it spoils it so the most I will say is that a family gets kidnapped.

Sure, I expect the movie to give me food for thought but is there some secret surprising 'twist' to the story? I didn't get that impression from the trailers and the movie didn't seem to be suggesting one and I just enjoyed each moment for what it was.

It’s the largest crew of any animated movie ever made! So many Easter eggs. They include references to six decades of movies, video games, cartoons, and comics. Wow. This is one of those movies that you HAVE to watch more than once in order to catch everything. Scratch that…two or three times! The frames fly so fast and furiously that you simply can’t see it all. I’ve never read comic books, but I hear the movie stays true to the source material. I got a kick out of the Spot villain, the Lego spider verse, and the Indian Spider-Man. haha I’ve always loved animated movies that include live-action characters. The cliffhanger will leave you counting the days until the next installment. Surprising twists caught me off guard. Sweet. There is plenty of humor, both spoken and visual. I’ve just seen a Nicolas Cage cameo in two different movies in two days! His appearance always gets a laugh from the audience. The other is in the new movie that just came out: The Flash. It’s another fun adventure into the metaverse! You can definitely enjoy this movie without having seen the first Spider-verse one; however, you’ll understand and appreciate it even more if you have. If you love Hailee Steinfeld’s character of Gwen Stacey, you’ll be excited to know that a female-focused spin-off is currently in development.

Asteroid City is not an 'easy' movie, often requiring the viewer to pay attention to small details that return later in satisfying and emotionally compelling ways — something made easier by the film's hypnotizing cinematography. Wes Anderson creatively makes use of multiple frame narratives in a manner rarely seen in modern cinema to tell an enchantingly beautiful story once you get to the core of it. Admittedly, it can get a little hard to follow at times, but yields good returns if you surrender your attention to this piece of art.""), ('7', ""Absence is the key word in Anderson's latest film. Absence of answers and absence of inspiration. ''Asteroid City'' reflects in an abstract, conceptual and lyrical way on the lack of meaning of living; on human beings who search for meanings and new awareness; the discovery of something authentic about ourselves and our place in the world, as well as the mysteries of existence. However, Anderson's aesthetic appears in this film to be folded in on itself, uninspired and not very functional on an expressive level. And in the end, emotional strength is also missing. A refined and accurate work, elegant and pleasant from a visual/formal point of view (the usual pastel colours, the frontal shots, the geometric lateral tracking shots, the moving sets, the infinite cast of stars, the anti-naturalistic staging), interesting underneath that of the narrative structure (an imaginary theater show, which is also a television show, which is also the film we are watching); but which unfortunately remains the victim of the overly calculated and somewhat dry weight of its approach. A unique and coherent cinema, that of Wes Anderson, always beautiful to look at and recognisable; but now we would like it to be a little less theoretical and ''repetitive'', and a little more aimed at that poetic novelty/authenticity originally possessed by the career, as well as at the human dimension that finds in the intensity of feelings the more engaging trait.

In Nietzsche\'s distinction between active nihilism, undisputed adherence to the status quo, and passive nihilism, its resigned and desperate rejection, the (neo)existentialist approach seems to coincide with the second typology, powerless to translate the denunciation into some constructive proposal. The Coens, Tarantino, McDonagh, the films adapted from McCarthy\'s novels are more attracting and satisfying thanks to pulp brutalities exhibited and shown. Instead, this last work by Anderson is dereliction in its pure state, expressly desert-like, an undaunted emphasize on the void of meaning that afflicts the cosmos, including any eventual alien. ""I still don\'t understand the play."" ""Doesn\'t matter. Just keep telling the story."" The unmistakable style of the director is at the service of the addicted coexistence with a perennial Apocalypse, the narrative plot takes place among the mushrooms of nuclear tests, Cranston enters a shot, asks if he is in the right place and then withdraws, they talk to suicides of suicides with a frozen and chilling tone, in the absurd logic and feelings lose all value.

He has such a unique, quirky style that entire YouTube channels have been devoted to him by visual artists who create movie trailers in his style. You have to see them! They’re hilarious and awesome! This movie was directed and written by Wes Anderson, with additional writing help from Roman Coppola. The story is about a father who takes his tech-obsessed children to Asteroid City, a small, rural town to compete in a junior stargazing event. His wife, their mother, recently died which changes his world view forever. The story is presented as a play written by a famous writer. THINGS I LIKED: The cast is absolutely fantastic and knocks it out of the park. It includes quite a few Academy Award winners and nominees: Ed Norton, Adrien Brody, Willem Dafoe, Margot Robbie, Bryan Cranston, Tilda Swinton, Tom Hanks, Scarlett Johansson, Jason Schwartzman, Live Schreiber, Matt Dillon, Jeffrey Wright, and so many more! I loved Ed Norton’s fun accent. There’s even an awesome Jeff Goldblum cameo, but don’t blink or you’ll miss it. I love how the camera frames things. Each frame could be a piece of art. Just soak everything in. It’s all so clever and intentional. This is NOT one of those movies that you can have playing in the background while you do something else in the room; you HAVE to watch the screen. The introduction to the characters at the beginning was amusing. Pay attention to their descriptions. The director wanted to film out in the middle of nowhere that was flat. He looked everywhere and finally found a spot in southern Spain. I lived in Spain for 2 years and loved it! Bryan Cranston compared making this movie to an actor’s dream camp. He loved having nightly banquets with all of the other actors. Bill Murray was going to be in the movie but he got Covid-19 right before filming, so Steve Carell stepped in to fill his role. Other than West Anderson’s first movie, Bottle Rocket in 1996, this is the first movie not to feature Bill Murray. The color palette changes from black and white to fully saturated color with a retro look. The dialogue, like all Wes Anderson is witty and delivered dry. I actually like it when actors break the fourth wall. In this movie, they tell the audience, “You can’t wake up if you don’t fall asleep.” While extremely humorous, the movie is also heartbreaking. The music and sound effects are absolutely perfect. THINGS I DIDN’T LIKE: The plot is thin, as if Wes Anderson were more interested in design and creating visually stunning scenes, but they’re not really strung together in a story that the audience can sink their teeth into. There are so many characters without a clear protagonist. There’s no villain or challenge that needs to be overcome. Shifting from color to black and white is an interesting director choice, but it felt more like a distraction than was necessary.

The delightfully artistic production design and appealingly pastel cinematograghy as usual from Wes Anderson's film.

First thing that comes to my mind is that his dark-comedic style and plot-driven actually leave some flaws on the smoothness of emotional relationship for each main characters. But, I somehow find its nice touch from seeing Wes digs deeper into human's loneliness by never leaving its fast pacing and his uniquely dark-comedic style, flawlessly and masterfully. The satire for political events and human connections are also never missed a beat. The unusual narrative can sometimes confuse audiences on their first-half watching, but even so, at some point, once the film reveals its self-concept, I'm pretty sure the audiences will somehow try connecting those dots that film had left for us all along, and certainly find a beauty of the hidden message.""), ('3', '""Asteroid City"" (6/23/23, PG13, $46M boxoff, D/Wes Anderson) is a visually splendant, eye-candy film featuring high-contrasty pastel colors set in the American southwest of 1955 co-starring many familiar A and B-list names and that\'s about all that\'s good to say about this film that didn\'t break-even at the box office and here\'s why...

All of the main characters get their moment in the movie; however, not all of the characters’ situations are resolved. Some characters get completely dropped after their moment and we never see them again. SPOILER: What happened to the traditional Fast and Furious with the family all eating together at a BBQ?

What a career he has had so far and he just barely turned 50! He’s a really good actor, director, and storyteller. Congrats and kudos to him! Michael Jordan wasn’t directly involved with the movie; however, Ben Affleck consulted with him several times to ensure the story was told accurately. Michael Jordan had two special requests: that Viola Davis play his mother and that Howard White be included in the movie. I love it that Ben Affleck included his long-time buddy, Matt Damon, in the movie. They both also serve as producers of the movie. Matt Damon actually wore a fat suit for this role as Sonny Vaccaro, mostly to give him a big belly. Both Ben Affleck and Matt Damon spent quite a bit of time rewriting the original screenplay, but due to some technical rules by the WGA, they weren’t given writing credits on the film. Boo! This is their 20th movie collaboration together! Viola Davis and Julius Tennon, who are actually married in real life, play Michael Jordan’s parents. The fantastic cast includes 3 Academy Award winners: Viola Davis, Matt Damon, and Ben Affleck! It also includes Jason Bateman, Chris Messina, Gustaf Skarsgard, Marlon Wayans, and Chris Tucker. Everyone did an excellent job in their roles. The movie credits open with a quick download of all of the trending things that were happening in the 1980s, long before the word “trending” was a thing, by the way. Michael Jordan wore two different numbers on his jerseys during his career: 45 & 23, so this movie, Air, was released on 4/5/23. Sweet! The fun soundtrack really took me back to the 80s. Ben Affleck wanted to use even more epic songs of the day but buying rights would have put him over budget. Everything is about branding these days. This movie illustrates how a successful company took it to another whole level! I’m always fascinated to learn how legends are made and what contributed to a successful company or marketing campaign. Lots of fun banter between characters. It’s the dialogue that drives the story. We get to see photos and images of all the real people involved in the true story at the end of the movie. We also get to see some of Michael Jordan’s magical moments on the court. THINGS I DIDN’T LIKE: It’s kind of odd that Michel Jordan or the character who plays him isn’t even in the script!

It\'s just too long. The action is great and very well done and enjoyable but after a while I started wondering ""ok, is this going to end, and move on soon?"" outside of the movie being 40 minutes to long. Everything else is great. If you like the other John Wick films you are going to like this one as well. The action like always is very well done and its a fun fast paced action movie which we sadly don\'t get a lot of these days. the plot as always is simple. Everyone is out to kill John Wick as he tried to put an end to it all. This film does finally end the series which I kind of wish the third one did. as much as I like the series I don\'t want to see John Wick 9. Just end the series and start something new.

It is entertaining, has a lot of good humor, tons of fan service and enjoyable characters. Sadly it will be one of those movies that is really good but no one watched. Also I have seen the first D&D movie in cinema that was hilariously bad (but entertaining). This is an improvement by several levels. I bought the movie on DVD after hearing many people praised it. It was even better than I hoped for. The story starts with the bard Edgin and female barbarian Holga in a prison. They hope to be pardoned and telling the story how they got into trouble. However this is just the set up as they did not know that there was more behind it. The story fully works. All characters have their flaws, motivations and heroes journey. More movies need to do this. I liked them because I can relate to their struggles. Everyone has doubts, made decisions that backfire or dis-improves things by trying to fix them. There are also tons of lore, easter eggs and references. If you pay attention you even see the characters from the old D&D cartoon. The cast is near perfect and fits their roles. Chris Pine, Michelle Rodrigues, Sophia Lillis, Rege Jean Page, Justine Smith and all the others are excellent and have great chemistry. The bad guys are so enjoyable. I love to hate them. I should also praise the writers and directors. They made an awesome movie. Other than that I praise the humor and action scenes. Both are fully satisfying. The special effects are great too. They fit into the movie in a way that feels genuine. Overall I think I should give a 10/10. It might not be that good but it is a positive surprise and immense improvement. Also they made some positive example how to subvert expectation (In a way that I would applaud).'), ('8', 'With a legitimate sense of wit and charm, Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves is a surprise hit for the action/fantasy genre.

It’s uses many prices of established D&D lore and it feels like a true D&D adventure. Lots of fun.'), ('6', 'I did NOT want to see this movie. I was steadfast against it because of the writers saying the quiet part out loud about purposely emasculating men. Spoiler alert: they weren\'t kidding (except for a nicely portrayed old school Paladin). But, being a parent of a teen, he was quite keen to see this movie, and we have strongly bonded over both baseball and old school AD&D, so off to the theater we went (matinee prices). I played AD&D in the 80s, during the height of the ""zomg satanic"" scares. My friends and I were, above all, nerds. Stranger Things portrayed that aspect of us quite well, minus the parallel world and telekinetic teen. It\'s been a joy to play AD&D as DM for my children and friends, although we are strictly a 1e, not 5e world. I\'m sort of pleased to see so many people trying to retrofit to 1e from 5e in light of latest drama. However, having said that, I still recognized that this movie was going to try to cater/nod its way towards 5e players. The inclusion of things like the Dragonborn and bird people(?) races confirmed that for me. To the critiques: Even APART from ""most tabletop adventures at home will be better than what the writers can come up with"" criticism (which I find quite valid), we shouldn\'t forget that Gary Gygax et al created just EPIC adventures in module form. Tomb of Horrors, the Against the Giants series, even The Temple of Elemental Evil are all rousing adventures that are just sort of . . . out there for inspiration. My son pointed out that adventures like that almost might be better for a streaming service, in a serial form. That would also allow for far more character development/arcs. More nitpicky: I guess that while I enjoyed the movie, I also had quite a few problems with the writers not taking a few simple extra steps for either fan service, or just . . . making the movie MORE like D&D. For instance, Capt. Kirk certainly is portrayed to be a Bard. The old Bard started off as a fighter, abandons that class to become a thief, and then after sufficient time becomes a Bard, whereupon the character can employ abilities from the two abandoned classes. Capt. Kirk is shown, early in the movie, to be a fighter (armored, with a sword), later gives that up to become a thief, and then wields a lute, but there\'s no mention as to why that\'s important. IS he even a Bard, or do they just go to efforts to make it look that way, and then ""lol nope?"" Even a throwaway line might have helped, much less him using his OWN lute to cast an illusion at a later point in the movie (I won\'t be specific since it\'s just out). Also, what was with the ""wheel of spells"" thing on the belt of the Magic User? Not a line about how he got it, what it even is, or why he is inept at selecting spells? Is it a random thing, like the Deck of Many Things, or a Wand of Wonder? There is a single mention of the word ""Cleric"" in the movie -- those are typically healers. With a bit more knowledge, the writers could have allowed the Magic User to say, at a CERTAIN point in the movie (""I can\'t help [person]. I\'m not a cleric.""). Something like that, at least. Finally, they went to a hell of a lot of trouble to obtain the helm -- did anyone see what became of it by the end of the movie? Is this a Shazam 2 thing, where in the next movie someone is going to find it in a museum? Despite all these criticisms overall the movie was certainly . . . mid. Worth the matinee price at least.

In ""Se7en"" I remember only one aphorism, the Hemingway quote uttered by Freeman as the movie\'s epilogue. In ""Fight Club"" Norton was the narrator but not a ""Nietzsche with a silencer"" (Leonardo Gandini). How much professional credibility would this killer have who observes his targets with lights on and curtains open or the other contractors who leave his girlfriend alive? Is he from today\'s generation just because the protagonist buys on Amazon and a character plays the Wordle Game?

He just monologues about the meticulous nature of work and the same mantra he says to himself to be an assassin.

I was disappointed when the story became a basic vengeance story after the first chapter. The whole thing feels a bit like watching the Hitman video game walkthrough (all these detailed preparation scenes and sneaking around), with some Assassin's Creed-style conversations as the killer chats with his victims. I was drifting off throughout the movie and the ending fell flat completely. The highest point for me was the Florida hand-to-hand fight scene. Just amazing fight choreography and physicality to the whole fight.""), ('7', 'In his latest film, ""The killer"", David Fincher takes us into the twisted mind of a solitary nameless hitman, in a work that is essentially a stream of consciousness, completely filtered from the perspective of a killer devoted to the denial of errors, improvisations, and everything that makes us human beings, such as affections, emotions and empathy. Taken from a comic miniseries written by Matz and illustrated by Luc Jacamon and published from 1998 to 2014 - for many viewers this film may seem banal, monotonous and boring in its linear, schematic, cold and repetitive nature, in reality if you watch it with the right approach you will become passionate, as the tense crescendo is not in the events but in the invisible evolution of the character; an infallible professional killer, highly trained, rigid in following his precise rules of conduct, who loves attention to detail and total control, yet unaware of self-deception on many aspects of his personality and reality, but also on his way of (not) relating to society and the people around him. The careful mix of writing and staging, as effective and controlled as the methodical, cold protagonist, manages to involve and conceal a stimulating reflection on the human psyche and contemporary society, suspended between order and disorder. In fact, the plot is only a pretext to let us enter the psyche of the killer (a convincing and credible Fassbender), who appears almost a re-visitation of the protagonists of Jean-Pierre Melville\'s detective/noir films, but with much less charm. The actor with his icy face manages to tell us all about the detachment but at the same time also the vulnerabilities of his character. Thriller (but also revenge movie) tense and with a geometric style, rich in style and visual refinement, both in staging and in form; ""The Killer"" is an elegant genre film which, thanks to its philosophical (the banality of Evil) and existential slant, is much more than it appears, and, although quite conventional, manages to be interesting and entertain with pleasure. In addition to the beautiful incipit, the director offers us at least two other memorable sequences: a fight in the dark in an apartment and a dialogue with the always good Tilda Swinton. The aforementioned direction is worthy of note, but also the photography and editing, as well as the soundtrack by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross (the alternation of silence with music, and of the monologue with the unsaid is admirable in this sense). In conclusion, ""The killer"" is one of the most successful and meaningful works in David Fincher\'s filmography, and it is recommended to watch it. Score (in tenths): 7.25'), ('8', 'Brilliantly shot, good plot. Good fight scenes. quite believable. Highly entertaining.'), ('6', ""Michael Fassbender plays a professional assassin, but since this was directed by David Fincher, you can expect something different. In this case, there are a few nicely dispatched kills, but lots of introspective inner monologues. After a hit goes wrong, he sets out across the world to dispatch the people responsible. In between the quick hits are long periods of Fassbender's steely presence, alone and traveling to his next victim. There's very little interaction with other people, although the scene with Tilda Swinton is the film's best moment, thanks to her nuanced performance. Otherwise, there's plenty of his subdued voiceover which lends an objective perspective lacking any emotion. Some might appreciate this cerebral approach to a character study, but anyone expecting an action flick with will have lots of waiting between shorts bursts"")}"

There was a theme in here I enjoyed that made Captain Marvel more human in my eyes, she made a mistake… a REALLY big one is all I will say and I appreciate it. She is the Superman of Marvel if, you will, though much much much younger in comic history. One thing that makes it tough for me to connect with such overpowered characters (DCs Batman is the best!) was their perfection. This movie stomped on that perfection. It is not a chick flick, there are no love scenes, there is no “snubbing of men” and as far as I could tell nothing “woke” or “agenda” oriented about the film, it is just a film with three females leads... My only qualm is, like with Dr.Strange and the Multiverse of Madness, you MUST watch Disney+ series (in this case Wanda Vision and Ms.Marvel) to have a background for two of the lead characters or at least the power origins of one. This isn’t really fair to the wider audience and a part of me had hoped Disney would abandon that notion for Marvel films after Multiverse of Madness but it looks like they are swinging full force with it for the future. And I am sure this played a role in the reception of the film. The mental plug you can desperately create for yourself while watching Multiverse of Madness (Wanda was of course in the past avengers movies but her motive, & power up and ill action references were only in Wanda Vision) is IMPOSSIBLE in The Marvels.

He does frenetic and tragic well, but this actor is a lot to take in. Knowing about the star’s interstate crime spree doesn’t help. Two Ezra Millers is just too much. Ezra and Grant would been a more watchable duo. My other issues are with the effects and the poor choices of how to use them. For recreating people, they left the uncanny valley and went back to 1995’s Pixar. For the big fight, they brought back Zod. Been there. Saw that. Wow me with something new. For the time travel scenes, they created some kind of colosseum of computer animated people and had Ezra run backwards. It’s at least better than seeing a bunch of clocks.

The film was directed by Andy Muschietti. Writing credits go to Christina Hodson and Joby Harold. Yep, it’s another Metaverse movie. It appears that’s what DC Comics is doing all of the time now. It’s the 13th movie in the DC Universe with a soft reboot of the DC franchise, led by James Gunn. Any other films outside this new timeline are going to be called DC Elseworlds. Are you still thinking all of this Metaverse hype is fun or are you growing tired of it? Just curious. Comment down below! THINGS I LIKED: I attended a press screening with an audience that was ready for a good time. Within 1 minute, the audience was laughing. Nice! There was also destruction and tons of action within minutes. Ezra Miller did a fantastic job playing two characters: The Flash and Barry Allen. He gives us two-in-one characters to root for and shows us two levels of maturity with entertaining nuances. I LOVED Michael Keaton as one of the Batmen in previous movies, so I loved that they brought him back for this! I thought it was really clever how they addressed how there could be so many different Batmen in our world by utilizing the Metaverse. Conveniently, this movie ignores the story in the 1995 Batman Forever, as well as the 1997 Batman and Robin to have the 1992 Batman Returns movie make more sense to fit Michael Keaton’s storyline. Michael Keaton is now, officially, the oldest actor to play a live-action Batman. He’s currently 71 years old. Adam West was actually 88 when he voiced the 2017 animation of Batman vs. Two-Face! Ben Affleck hasn’t been my favorite Batman, but he did a good job in this. I loved the ending of the movie that left us all hanging as to who will be the next Batman in THIS universe! Ha ha Ben Affleck had some issues with the Justice League movie but revealed in a recent interview that he really enjoyed his role in this movie, as short as it was. The audience I watched the movie with absolutely loved the montage of Superman actors, especially Nicolas Cage who was ALMOST a superhero in a Superman movie many years ago in real life. Michael Shannon always does such a great job as a villain. His clear mask on his space uniform was pretty cool. Super amusing sound effects. While this movie isn’t exactly an origin story for The Flash, we get to learn a lot more about him, his past, and his motivations. Sasha Calle is the first Latina to play Supergirl. Congrats, Sasha! Others in the cast include Kiersey Clemons, Ron Livingston, Ian Loh, and Saoirse-Monica Jack. Everyone did a great job. The movie was shot entirely with IMAX cameras by Henry Braham. The only other DC movie to do that was the 2021 movie The Suicide Squad. Great special effects. I always love the Flash’s slow-motion sequences, so I was surprised when the guy I sat next to leaned over and said he thought they lasted too long. I still loved them. I loved the very last scene. What a great cliffhanger. The big bad spaceship looked just like a beetle. Some of the designs for weapons were cool too. THINGS I DIDN’T LIKE: Gotham City is always falling apart. Ha ha If you get vertigo as I do, be warned that there will be a few scenes that make you a little bit dizzy. There mostly at the beginning of the movie. I was worried it was going to be like that the entire time, but it wasn’t. Drats…I’m getting old! I wanted to hear the audience’s reactions throughout the film, but the movie was really loud and drowned out most of the noise from the audience. Surprisingly, there are some fake CGI moments. Some of the action sequences looked like they came straight out of a video game. Some viewers might complain about the unnecessarily long length of the movie. Everyone bleeds from the mouth with fake makeup. Ha ha TIPS FOR PARENTS: A few conversations about intimate relations. A surprisingly high number of crude words. Come on, Hollywood!

For starters, I was quite intrigued and eager to see this one in order to compare it to last year's 'Elvis' biopic with Austin Butler. The key differences here are, for starters, the obvious one, which is that this is very much Priscilla's story and perspective this time around. Elvis is a key player here too of course, but most of his scenes and moments are merely context and afterthoughts. Another big contrast is that last year's 'Elvis' film focused very little on his marriage and family life. Unlike that film, we're given next to no detail about Elvis's own turmoil that he was suffering through with his numerous infidelities, substance abuse, and of course his financial abuse at the hands of Col. Tom Parker. We're quite literally seeing Elvis's downward spiral and at times harsh treatment of Priscilla through her eyes in this film. This proved a unique and much more intimate approach to his and Priscilla's story. In addition, Cailee Spaeny gives a star-making turn as Priscilla. Her quiet subtlety here gives way to many heartbreaking moments throughout. As for the king, Jacob Elordi gives a much more brooding and subdued performance than that of Austin Butler's from last year, and while at first glance it may not feel as fully realized or fleshed out as Butler's, this is okay, because you have to remember that in this film, we're only meant to see snippets of what he was going through since we're viewing his struggles and suffering through Priscilla's eyes. Another big highlight was the makeup and hairstyling. The recreations of Priscilla's outfits and hairdos were unbelievably impressive, and if this were a more high-profile film, I'd definitely vouch for it deserving an Oscar nomination in this category in particular. Narratively, a lot of scenes do feel a little redundant and repetitive at times, and while it does admittedly lack the glitz and glamor of last year's 'Elvis', even feeling a little TOO basic by comparison, it makes up for this through simply serving as a poignant and nuanced character study of two individuals whose turbulent marriage/relationship captivated the world for years. In addition, it really does give you a vivid image of just how young Priscilla was when she met Elvis and was so suddenly thrust into a world of fame, luxury, and unwanted attention at the cost of first love. Overall, a basic premise and setup, but Spaeny and Elordi both turn in memorable and committed performances here, and Coppola, who has such a keen and natural eye for the female adolescent gaze and experience, paints a vivid picture of one of the most troubled and tragic women to ever catch the attention of the public eye.""), ('10', 'An amazingly spellbinding perfection!! Sofia Coppola crafts one of the most distinctively sublime biopic, with the solid faithfulness in perspective like a true master of cinema. Undoubtly, if ""Lost in Translation"" is Sofia Coppola\'s #1 best film of her directing career..., ""Priscilla"" will certianly place right behind it as her #2 best!!'), ('5', ""This film details Priscilla Presley's courtship and marriage to Elvis Presley, starting when she meets him at age 15 living in Germany with her parents. His creepy obsession with her develops into their eventual nuptials, but we know from her book that he treated her like a dress-up doll with very specific guidelines for her presentation. As for Elvis' POV, Jacob Elordi doesn't look or sound much like the real thing and lacks much charisma (there's also none of his music). In the title role, Cailee Spaeny effectively transitions from innocence to miserable to determined. Writer/director Sofia Coppola has obsessed over the details of Priscilla's rise and fall with lovely wardrobe and cool cars. Even thought there's some mean treatment and sad outcomes, there's never much emotional connection, rendering the whole affair (pun intended) sad. It's especially distracting that she chose to shoot the entire picture with a dark overtone that makes it hard to see faces…even the poolside scenes are moody. I guess Coppolla is trying to emphasize the dreary aspects of the relationship, but her focus on the exterior elements ultimately makes Priscilla's story sympathetic but flat."")}"
The Holdovers,"Oct 27, 2023",2 h 13 m,81,7.5,"{('6', 'NOT a comedy like the previews show. It has some funny school-boy lines at the start, but quickly descends into the harsh realities of life and the consequences of dealing with them. Dominic Sessa is a 33 year old actor tying to play the part of a high school junior, which is pretty pathetic and fake, especially if you know what a 16 year old junior in high school really looks like.

An excellent period piece.'), ('7', 'While the acting and writing of this movie is excellent, wherever critics got their viewpoint that this movie is a comedy, alludes me. The movie is very touching and sad to the point where it made me cry. What is funny about holiday loneliness, mental illness, death from war, parents who care more about themselves than their children, corruption in school systems, alcoholism etc. ? This is not an uplifting movie. Be prepared to come out a bit depressed.'), ('8', ""In this latest offering from director Alexander Payne ('Election', 'Sideways', 'The Descendants', etc.), set in the 70s, a grumpy and contentious college history professor (Paul Giamatti) finds himself stuck on campus watching over the handful of young men unable to return home for the holidays for various reasons, and finds himself unexpectedly bonding and sympathizing with a particularly troubled young student (Dominic Sessa in an incredible debut). First of all, I didn't have too high of expectations going into this one, because truth be told, I've never really been all that big on Alexander Payne films. They've typically never been my cup of tea, as I find them a little too straightforward, pedestrian, or simply not funny or memorable enough. Most people seem to love his sophomore film 'Election', which I always found incredibly overrated and populated with nothing but unlikable characters. 'The Descendants' was cute and at times emotional, but also mostly forgettable in my eyes. And 'Nebraska' was simply boring and too understated. The only film of his I've ever truly loved is 'Sideways', which was full of wit, humor, and heart. Coincidentally enough, this was the only other time him and Giamatti worked together, that is until this film of course. And after watching this one, I've come to the conclusion that both of these men collaborating together creates pure onscreen magic, because I absolutely adored just about every minute of this funny, heartwarming, and charming little film. And yes, this is largely in part thanks to Giamatti and his brash yet yet compelling and humorous performance, but his chemistry and onscreen charisma and presence, particularly with newcomer Dominic Sessa is also the film's biggest highlight by far. However , Davine Joy Randolph also gives a superb supporting turn here as well. In addition, the screenplay and dialogue is witty and heartwarming in all the right places. Overall, this is a surprising yet very welcome return to form for Payne, and a long overdue reunion between him and Giamatti. I also now consider it the only other truly great film from Payne besides 'Sideways', which to me says a lot. I'm certain it'll charm and delight the pants off of most folks like it did me.""), ('6', 'Heartwarming films for the holidays are something we’re all supposed to love, right? Well, if you’re talking about the works of directors like Frank Capra, George Seaton, Michael Curtiz and Chris Columbus, you’d be correct. But, since it’s been so long since we’ve had releases of that quality, in recent years, viewers hungry for such movies have been glomming on to anything that even remotely approaches such titles, whether or not the accolades are deserved. And that, in my view, sums up my feelings on the much-celebrated new feature from director Alexander Payne. This tale of a curmudgeonly, condescending, middle-aged, fuss-budget prep school teacher (Paul Giamatti) assigned to babysit a group of rambunctious students who are unable to be with their families for the year-end holidays has a premise with considerable potential that, unfortunately, is squandered by a narrative that feels loosely stitched together and ultimately comes across as patently undercooked. Indeed, what could have been a fun-filled romp a la a Christmastime take on movies like “Dead Poets Society” (1989), regrettably, comes up decidedly short. Admittedly, the film has its share of modestly funny and warm, fuzzy moments, but many of the scenes don’t flow smoothly from one to the next, creating a storyline that feels forced without delivering the goods to make a release like this work. While it’s true that the film succeeds (surprisingly) at depicting the mostly one-dimensional characters’ requisite personal evolution over the course of the picture, that almost-accidental accomplishment is seriously overshadowed by a series of plot elements that largely feel thrown together, incorporated without a terribly great amount of thought and an undeniable lack of cohesiveness. And, to be honest, the picture’s most interesting character is the academy’s chief cook (Da’Vine Joy Randolph), whose richly layered persona (and deftly nuanced performance) runs circles around those of its other two principals (Giamatti and Dominic Sessa as one of the stranded students). It’s disappointing that a director as talented as Alexander Payne has churned out a project as half-baked as this one is (particularly one that comes across as self-satisfied with itself as this offering often does) when compared to previous titles like “Nebraska” (2013) and “The Descendants” (2011). And would-be viewers should be wary of many of the inflated claims and awards season buzz being showered on this offering. But, in an age in which moviegoers are looking for pictures that provide the kind of holiday cinema comfort they so desperately crave, it’s understandable that such viewers might be drawn to a film like this. It’s just such a shame that they won’t find what they’re looking for in this one.'), ('8', 'I’m a big Alexander Payne guy, and this is just so cozy and funny and real like he (typically) is.'), ('10', 'Pure cinematic nostalgia. I was reminded of a time in life; my version of these events. Payne makes coming-of-age stories about grown ups. As if there were an important basic childhood lesson that was missed, which creates a hole that needs to get smoothed over. Since this movie is set over the holidays, we have our Scrooge character and then we have various archetypes, or values, presented by other characters. Do we have more in common with others that we thought? Are we missing out on friendships right under our nose? Is life about adjusting to certain discomforts or radically rejecting them until we achieve satisfaction? There are some profound moments in the film, and they are all deftly handled with a lot of organic breathing room given to the actors to feel out the scene. The beautiful production design (including the choices of camera, film (?), color) sets the stage for the actors to really step into the shoes of the characters. All the performances are good and memorable down to the smallest part. That’s all I would need to say about the direction. The script is fantastic. I haven’t read it, but it feels brought to life accurately. I can feel the script in the film but not in a stuffy way. It has structure, pathos and great little moments that are brought to life through creative interpretation. It feels like a well considered film, neither too far a drama or a comedy; as Dramedies go I’d say it’s 50/50. Many moments are fun and poignant at the same time. I expect The Holdovers to be even more poignant on second viewing now knowing the characters’ full arcs. What impresses me so much about the characters is that they arrive fully formed, they are fully formed throughout, and it ends with them fully formed. Yes there is character growth, but it’s that character growing, not being re-written into someone they weren’t already to begin with. The actors are given a lot of bandwidth to continually bring out different aspects of their characters so nothing feels out of place later whether it’s an aggression or a kindness. Someone can be harsh in one moment, and nice to someone in the next. That’s what life is like. There’s not a firm line between “hero” and “villain” like in many works of fiction. Everyone is the “hero” of their own journey, but sometimes they took an arrow without realizing it. And not until they stop blindly moving forward (or half blind?) for a holiday break can they realize where damage was done, pull out the arrow, and make the necessary adjustments to turn the next page of their hero’s journey. The Holdovers is a beautifully story, well told, and a reminder that the scope of a film can be epic even in small moments as long as we understand who the characters are and their choices have weight. 9.5/10'), ('7', ""Paul Giamatti plays a grumpy teacher at a private New England prep school who's assigned to stay over the Christmas break with the students stuck there. Ultimately, he ends up with one particularly smart but troubled lad (newcomer Dominic Sessa, who's actually 22). They butt heads continuously with the only refuge for understanding from the school's head cook (Da'Vine Joy Randolph). As expected, the softening of their strife ends up with quiet connections and underplayed emotions. Since this was directed by Andrew Payne, there's a dry humorous approach that helps make the dramatic elements more palatable. Giamatti creates a curmudgeon with underlying sadness that serves as the film's core. The other performances are genuine and heartfelt. While the outcome is predictable, getting there is a sweet and salty character drama."")}"

Lewd comments and unexplained scars, check and check. This is more than enough to call in the expert and who better to call than someone who’s experienced these horrors before, 50 years ago.

If it was scary or entertaining I could get over that but unfortunately horror fans will be neither scared nor entertained. There are a couple of things that happen in this movie that I can’t mention for spoiler reasons, but I felt the disrespect to the original and the characters so I can’t see that going down well, especially with all The Exorcist fans. Most cinemas re-released the original Exorcist for the 50th anniversary so for anyone in the mood for this kind of horror movie you’d be better off with that instead. You’re in safe hands with William Friedkin, I can’t say the same for David Gordon Green, who gave us such films like Halloween 2018, Halloween Kills and Halloween Ends. It’s hard to believe this is considered a financial success, especially seeing the completely empty screen I was in and we’re pretty much guaranteed more Exorcist movies. Don’t everyone cheer at once. Whereas I wouldn’t be remotely excited for another movie in this franchise I would see another movie in The Pope’s Exorcist franchise for one reason. That film, although completely ridiculous was entertaining. This on the other hand, despite a promising start was bland, formulaic and not scary. No exorcism movie has ever come close to the original Exorcist and die-hard fans of that movie will not be impressed by this new one. But then again the bar was very high.

After an extremely hot ""dance"" number with a rich socialite (Salma Hayek Pinault), she convinces him to come to London to create one last blowout show. What gave the other films their heft (in addition to the flexing bare torsos) was the interaction among the dancers. This time, the former crew is relegated to a cameo moment, while the new crew remains a largely anonymous band of generic hunks. That means the real story is between Tatum and Pinault (in a modern angle her character is a mature woman). Luckily their chemistry sizzles, but their relationship boils down to lots of dull drama. Since it\'s directed by Steven Soderbergh, there\'s some depth to the performances, but let\'s be real: The main reason for this series is for the flashy dancing hotties. This time, the choreo is impressively snappy, but lacks much passion or playful fun.

Despite audiences mostly loving it, there has been a lot of criticism about various elements in the remake from Hans Christian Anderson purists to the drag community, finding fault with casting and makeup and everything else about it. Disney doesn’t seem to care, as they already have two more live-action remakes scheduled to hit the Big Screen in the near future. This version of the popular Disney musical was directed by Rob Marshall. Writing credits go to David Magee. Just like the original animation, the story is about a young mermaid who makes a deal with the sea witch to trade her beautiful voice for human legs so she can discover the world above water and impress a prince. With all of its controversy, what did YOU think of the movie? On a personal note, I watched the original animated movie with my children when they were very young. I have a melancholy attachment to it, so my expectations were extremely high. I still favor the original, but this one is still a nice addition to the Disney collection. THINGS I LIKED: This remake features the lovely Halle Bailey as Ariel. She has a beautiful voice and truly captures the look of wonder as she discovers the world of humans. When it was revealed that she got the leading part in the movie, the hashtag #NotMyAriel went viral. The controversy wasn’t necessarily because she’s African American but because a Black Ariel wasn’t true to the Danish origin of the story by Hans Christian Andersen. If you’ve seen the movie, do you agree or disagree with that sentiment? I LOVE that this film includes a cute cameo with Jodi Benson, who voices the original Ariel in the animation. In this movie, the actress/singer is seen as the person who gives the new Ariel a fork (“dinglehopper”). Jonah Hauer-King compliments Ariel as Prince Eric. I wish we could have gotten to know his personality a little better. The rest of the talented cast includes Melissa McCarthy, Javier Bardem, Awkwafina, Noma Dumezweni, Daveed Diggs, Jacob Tremblay, Art Malik, and more. Lizzo auditioned for the role of Ursula and even wore an octopus costume. I’m a fan of Melissa McCarthy and thought she did a fine job, even doing all of her own singing after being coached by Eric Vetro. It just made me wonder if Lizzo might have even been a stronger Ursula, certainly in the singing department. Bette Midler would have also been absolutely fantastic (I adore Ms. M), but Disney didn’t even reach out to her. This version honors the original animation while giving new legs to a new generation of little girls who don’t look like the typical Disney Princess of old. It’s so colorful, vibrant, and imaginative. I love all of the undersea creatures and how they interact with Ariel…except the sea snakes. Ick. The costume designer, Colleen Atwood, worked very hard to ensure all of the merpeople had accessories that were actually made from the sea. Disney swapped out the Old English Sheepdog for a Bearded Collie, just like it did in the 2006 movie The Shaggy Dog. We get four new songs in this version. The music was written by Alan Menken, just like in the original, but the lyrics were created by Lin-Manuel Miranda, the talented creator of the huge Broadway hit “Hamilton.” He also did the lyrics for Moana and several other musicals. Fun fact: It took 4 years to film the movie because production had to shut down during the Covid-19 pandemic. THINGS I DIDN’T LIKE: I admit that I’m completely biased in favor of the original The Little Mermaid because I have so many special memories of watching it with my children. That being said, this version isn’t as bad as some people are saying. It just doesn’t have quite the Disney magic and spark as the original…for me. One of the biggest complaints I’ve been hearing about this remake addresses the pacing. I tend to agree. There was no need to make this movie so long. I wish Sebastian’s little face could have been more expressive. If you struggle with vertigo as I do, you might get dizzy during a few scenes when the camera spins through seaweed and coral really fast under the sea. Now as a mother watching this story, it just made me laugh at how quickly and easily Ariel fell in love with someone she had never even met or talked to. Some of the mermaids look super CGI. I was sad that two songs from the original animation were removed: “Daughters of Triton” and “Les Poissons.” Sadly, also missing is the adorable Chef Louis. Since this is the age of feminism, Scuttle, the male seagull in the original animation is now a female. The song “Scuttlebutt” song was more annoying than charming.

The Super Mario Bros. Movie,"Apr 5, 2023",1 h 32 m,46,8.3,"{('9', 'IN A NUTSHELL: Can you believe I’ve never played any of the Mario Brothers games? I have four sons, so it definitely was played in my home for years. I tried playing it once, but that was when my kids were out for blood and absolutely did not let me win just to humor me. They would kill me within minutes. I did notice that whether my sons had guy friends or girl friends over to hang out, everyone wanted to play it. I spent a lot of money on Nintendo over the years! While critics are not loving this thinly-plotted movie adaptation, fans are giving it a big thumbs up and being swept away by the nostalgia. Because the game has been so beloved for four decades, the pressure was definitely on to get it right. The film was directed by Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic. The script was written by Matthew Fogel. THINGS I LIKED: The fantastic voice talent includes Chris Pratt, Anya Taylor-Joy, Jack Black, Seth Rogen, Keegan-Michael Key, Charlie Day, Fred Armisen, Sebastian Maniscalco, and Kevin Michael Richardson. They all did an excellent job. Many of them showed up at the premiere wearing outfits that paid tribute to their characters. Cute! Jack Black had some great moments in the movie. I always love it when he sings! It’s never great, but always hilarious. Seth Rogen’s laugh is so recognizable, so it was funny to hear Donkey Kong laugh like that. Fans will get a kick out of all the hidden Easter eggs, which are many! In fact, the game appears to be designed as pure fan service. If you see this in the movie theater, you’ll be surrounded by enthusiastic fans who will cheer and clap, making it all the more fun. It’s extremely colorful with enough details in every frame to keep you entertained and engaged. I love details. I love that simple scenes include the up-and-down movement of the game, as characters jump and climb to get over obstacles. Clever. Nice animation brings the video game back to life but in a more detailed way. The pasta looked delicious! Lots of amusing humor, both spoken and visual. The music and sound effects are super fun. The Mushroom Kingdom looks fantastic and so magical! That’s when the movie really came alive for me. It’s one of the best video-game adaptations I’ve seen on the Big Screen. Adorable ending. THINGS I DIDN’T LIKE: There is no real character growth. Because I’ve never played the game, I was hoping to learn more about the characters and backstories. Adults who have never played the game won’t be as interested, deciding it’s just a whole lot of color and noise like a cartoon that plays on the TV while the kids engage with other toys and activities in the same room. The plot is very simple and thin. I agree with the critics. The story doesn’t move the scenes forward. Instead, the scenes exist for fan service with a weak plot that stitches them together. Some of the songs don’t quite fit the video game but will resonate with older fans of the Nintendo era. I wanted to see all of the details in the backgrounds, but they were usually blurred out.

There is like 15 minutes of exposition explaining who did what and why but that is so boring. Surely they could have explained it better? Anyway, another wasted potential and waste of time aside.

Monika from friends now looks like that recent picture of Madonna, where she looks like the Jigsaw Killer from \'Saw.\' Accordingly, I now call her \'Madonika.\' Coming up with that name was the best part of this film. Unsurprisingly, she is also dating someone black, meaning that not one same-race couple exists in this film, as though it doesn\'t exist in real life.

It came out 11 years after Scream 4 and it was the first to not be directed by Wes Craven. It felt like it shouldn't have worked, but it did! Now after a significantly smaller gap of just 1 year, we have another instalment in the Scream franchise. Does it continue to be a slashing entry or is this going to be the first to fall flat on its face? Firstly, I love the change in setting for this film. Bringing the franchise out of Woodsboro made this a more interesting entry. We get to see Ghostface kill in the city and that leads to a lot of interesting set pieces. A memorable one was Ghostface hiding amongst other Halloween people on a subway. These scenes are incredibly tense and suspenseful. I also love how brutal this new Ghostface is. The way they stab their victims, hunt the main characters and hurt anyone in their way is unsettling. The opening scene was also a terrific way of subverting expectations. The mystery surrounding the new Ghostface is engaging and effective in its execution. Neve Campbell does not return as Sidney for the first time in the series due to a pay dispute which is a shame. However, I think the way her character is handled is done respectfully. Her absence leads to a focus on the characters from Scream V and it makes the film a lot better. On that note, Melissa and Jenna return as Sam and Tara respectively from Scream V and I liked them more here. I liked how both characters handled the traumatic events in that film. Sam is very cautious and protective of her sister since the event but Tara just wants to move on. I especially enjoyed Sam's struggle with her inner darkness which was hinted at in the previous film. The surviving supporting cast from Scream V also has more depth this time with their friendship with Sam and Tara being more meaningful. Courteney Cox returns as Gale and despite being a small role, she has an enjoyable and tense scene with Ghostface. The biggest surprise was Hayden Panettiere returning as Kirby from Scream 4. The last we saw of her was her getting stabbed and bleeding out so it was a surprise to see her alive. I enjoyed seeing how she also changed since Scream 4. She is more hardened and resolved but unlike with Sidney, it's hard to tell if it is truly genuine or if she is Ghostface. Nevertheless, I do have some issues with it. My biggest is characters surviving fatal wounds. Some characters would get stabbed in the gut and leg but still have loads of energy to fight with no issues. You could argue that it is Adrenaline but it is kind of weird. Some characters survive getting stabbed dozens of times which is just plain ridiculous. It felt like they were scared to kill off characters. The story also relies on plot conveniences and incompetent cops. The Ghostface is hunting our main characters and none of the police think to stay with them. Once it is revealed who is Ghostface, their plan feels a bit ridiculous and also feels like it could have easily been uncovered if anyone from the police or FBI weren't dumb. Overall, Scream continues to deliver refreshing movies in the slasher genre. 6 movies in and there isn't a terrible movie in the franchise.

THINGS I LIKED: The lineup of actors is fantastic and includes Paul Dano, Pete Davidson, Vincent D’Onofrio, America Ferrera, Nick Offerman, Anthony Ramos, Seth Rogen, Talia Ryder, Sebastian Stan, Shailene Woodley, Myha’la Herrold, Clancy Brown, and so many more. They created quirky, fun characters, and all did an outstanding job. Remember the Winklevoss twins in the movie The Social Network? They’re two of the executive producers for this movie. They got into a legal battle with Mark Zuckerberg, which was written about in the book “The Accidental Billionaires” written by Ben Mezrich. Ben Mezrich also wrote the book “The Antisocial Network”, which is what inspired this movie. I thought it was funny that the waitress knew about stocks and investing. Who doesn’t love a good underdog movie, especially when people who are struggling in the economy can stick it to the “Man”? The movie does a great job illustrating the nuances of living in a pandemic. Even if you don’t completely understand the investment world, you’ll still enjoy the story that shows the “little guy” beating out supposedly smarter Wall Street experts. Thanks to a real-life video clip by Steven Colbert, the film explains what a short sale or short squeeze is. There is a lot of spoken and visual humor. We get to see video clips of the real people involved in these events at the end of the movie THINGS I DIDN’T LIKE: The real Ken Griffin is entrenched in a lawsuit over how his character has been portrayed by Nick Offerman in the film. There are so many characters to try to keep track of. Some viewers have complained that this movie has come out too soon. Do you agree? I spent a lot of money buying video games for my 4 sons over the years. Too bad I didn’t invest during this unprecedented rise! Boomers might be annoyed by all of the raunchy Millennials. TIPS FOR PARENTS: Kids will be completely bored hearing about stocks. More importantly, the dialogue and the lyrics to the soundtrack are filthy and profane.

It's got everything from mixed-race, lesbian couples to camp, black men and there's a string of feminist-rap songs which don't really suit the actual scene. It's like they're just put them to promote radical feminism. The sad irony is that the movie is supposed to be about the average person being manipulated by the large corporations who control everything in covert ways, but the writers were obviously lacking the self-awareness to realise that that's exactly what they were perpetuating with their toxic, radical-left agenda-pushing. So, I would say this film is cancerous for the mind, like every movie that forces you to watch mixed-race lesbians, even though most of us have never actually met anyone like this in real life because they are rarer than a pink-haired woman at a pro-life rally.""), ('5', ""Love the concept but the movie overall was sloppy with its delivery.

Just watch the early 2000s film with Eddie Murphy, it's far better.""), ('7', 'IN A NUTSHELL: Featuring the iconic attraction at Disneyland, this story is about a single mother and son who move into a house, only to discover it is haunted. They recruit the help of a tour guide, psychic, priest, and historian only to learn there is much more to the ghosts than anyone was prepared for. THINGS I LIKED: If you love the Haunted Mansion ride at Disneyland, you’ll love all of the scenes that honor the spirit of that fan favorite. So many Easter eggs to enjoy! The cast includes reliable fan favorites too: Jared Leto, Jamie Lee Curtis, Owen Wilson, Danny DeVito, Tiffany Haddish, LaKeith Stanfield, and Rosario Dawson. We’re also treated to the young Chase W. Dillon, who might be new to some viewers. They all do a great job. The special effects that make the ghosts look truly ghostly worked really well to resemble what we see in the famous ride at the theme park. The name of the mansion, Gracey Manor, is to honor Yale Gracey, a Disney Imagineer who originated the illusion of the ghosts flying around the dining room table in the theme park. Lots of humor with snarky dialogue and physical gags. The film does a great job showcasing the unique vibe of New Orleans. It’s very different from the 2003 film of the same name. The sound effects are terrific. You really hear all of the creaks you would expect in a haunted house. There is a lot of action, but it’s blended well with touching moments and heart. Each of the characters gets the spotlight at least once and experiences some growth. That’s impressive for an ensemble cast. THINGS I DIDN’T LIKE: It’s a bit too long. Some viewers are complaining the movie isn’t scary enough, but I disagree. Disneyland was originally created for families, so I don’t think the film should be too scary. Guillermo del Toro was originally involved and, if he had remained, I have no doubt this movie would have been scarier! Not all of the jokes land. A lot of the talented actors are underutilized. A lot of the action sequences are chaotic. Why wasn’t this movie released closer to Halloween? TIPS FOR PARENTS: Lots of scary images for young children Violence Destruction You might have to explain what a séance is.'), ('5', ""Haunted Mansion is Disney's second attempt at making a movie based on the titled ride. The 2003 version starring Eddie Murphy was critically not well received and flopped at the box office. However, it has a cult following nowadays and honestly, it's a decently fun movie. Does this second attempt deliver more or is it just another failed attempt at turning another ride into the next Pirates of the Caribbean? One of the biggest things you will get out of this film is how amazing Lakeith Stanfield is as the main lead. He delivers a standout performance with some genuinely strong emotional performance from him. This is thanks to how his character is written. It is surprising to see Disney have an adult character dealing with loss and still grieving from it. He is also an introverted character with anxiety issues which is not something you see a lot from main characters in big IPs. His character is the heart and most engaging element. His character development is a wonderful thing to watch. The exploration of grief is well-done and it's a meaningful theme to explore in a family film. The cast also all have decent chemistry. Owen Wilson just steals a lot of the scene with his charisma. Danny Devito is a bundle of joy as usual. Tiffany Haddish is good during the more serious and emotional stuff but her comedy is a mixed bag. Rosario Dawson is mostly serious but it works fine. It is at its most enjoyable when the cast is bouncing off each other. Jamie Lee Curtis has a minor role as Madame Leota but she does great with her small screen time. The first act started strong with some decent horror and tension. Some of the scares are pretty surprising for a movie that is also aimed at kids. There are also some great visual sequences. For example, the door opening to a sea or the hallways becoming longer or the pictures starting to move behind the character's back. Unfortunately, it becomes pretty bland after the initial strong start. The second and third act start ditching any of the horror energy and becomes an adventure movie. It becomes reliant on jump scares but none of them are really that effective. The plot is also very standard and forgettable. There isn't any interesting character development for other characters nor is there any great twist or revelations in the plot. It doesn't help that this movie tries to be a PG13 horror but also a comedy and is not good at either. There are so many silly jokes and dialogue that just don't land. It didn't even give me a chuckle. The movie is 2 hours and that is too long. There are many moments where the pacing is just slow or where scenes drag on longer than necessary or there is a pointless padding scene. 20 minutes could have been easily cut out of this film which would no doubt help the pacing. I'm also saddened by how reliant this movie is on CGI. A lot of the ghosts are CGI and the effects are CGI, all of which are very noticeable. It's a shame as most of these could have been done practically and look way better for it. It baffles me that the main antagonist is CGI. Could they not get Jared Leto in prosthetics or something? Also, there are so many noticeable product placements as well. There are so many dialogues where characters randomly mention products for no reason. For example, a character mentions getting a mansion from Zillow or getting stuff from Costco. The biggest offender was during a serious moment and the character mentions Baskin Robbins which took me out of the moment. Overall, Haunted Mansion 2023 is a decent second attempt. It's not amazing or that memorable and it's not better or worse than the 2003 version. It's an okay movie but I definitely expected better from a movie with Disney money.

I don’t ever review movies but this deserves one because the meta rating is much lower than a film of this caliber should deserve. It will achieve cult status in the spooky season genre no doubt.

Well although these theme park movies have served them well in the past (5 Pirates of the Caribbean movies, Jungle Cruise etc.), they’ve now had a go at a spooky tale suitable for the whole family. Well that was the idea but unfortunately this new Haunted Mansion movie will be too scary for some young viewers and too boring for everyone else. Not even a strong cast made up of LaKeith Stanfield, Rosario Dawson, Owen Wilson, Tiffany Haddish, Danny DeVito, and Jamie Lee Curtis is enough to save this snooze-fest. A single mother, Gabbie (Rosario Dawson) moves into a lovely mansion that unfortunately is also home to a whole bunch of ghosts. Enter a tour guide (LaKeith Stanfield) a priest (Owen Wilson), a psychic (Tiffany Haddish) and a historian (Danny DeVito) to all get together and help exorcise the ghosts from the Haunted Mansion. An unlikely group of heroes forced together in a very unusual circumstance that should have resulted in a comedic spooky tale but ends up as a bland, boring story that I couldn’t wait to be finally over. This isn’t the worst film I’ve seen all year but it’s close. Haunted Mansion fails at a family comedy and fails as a spooky ghost story. It’s got a dull script that even a good cast can’t do anything with. The effects are horrendous, you’d see better looking ghosts in a PS2 game. It can’t fit comfortably into a genre because it’s not funny and not scary. This felt endless and I can’t believe it’s only two hours because it felt more like four. The idea was good and clearly there’s lots to work with from the theme park ride, as all these ghosts with different back stories keep showing up throughout the film. There’s certainly enough of them stuffed into it and perhaps it would have been better as a mini series to explore some of the different ghost tales and actually develop some characters instead of quickly jamming them altogether into the mansion as quick as possible with the 999 other ghosts before the really evil ghost completes his plan of collecting 1000 souls. Haunted Mansion moves from one haunted room to another, leaving you feeling like you’d rather be in the haunted mansion ride itself rather than this. Hell even those little crappy ghost trains we all got dragged to at some point as a child is better than this because it’s over quicker. I went in with low expectations and I was still disappointed. Haunted Mansion is a wasted opportunity because with that cast it should have been a hell of a lot better than the result. And it’s really not their fault, without a good script you don’t have a good movie and if Disney put an actual film maker in charge of things they might end up with better material because they’ve long since shown themselves to be completely out of ideas. Too bad they can’t understand the importance of good writers and yet another mediocre theme park based movie only serves as a further reminder that originality died at Disney years ago. We’re entering spooky season now and there are so many better things you could watch instead of this utter mess, Casper, The Nightmare Before Christmas, The Addams Family, Coraline, Beetlejuice and of course Hocus Pocus. Honestly there’s episodes of Scooby-Doo that are more entertaining than Haunted Mansion. But for anyone genuinely looking for a not too scary Halloween movie for the whole family, check out any of the above and skip this utter mess of a movie because there’s very few people I’d recommend this to. Haunted Mansion is recommended for die-hard fans of the theme park, I’m not saying you’ll all enjoy it but if this movie was made for anyone, it’s you guys. For everyone else, I’d say skip this one.'), ('3', 'Wish I could ask Disney why this film was made and who for.

Owen Wilson was a great supporting actor in this movie as well and Rosario did excellently as she always does.

Furthermore, photography and framings are banally gothic, expressionistic, romantically lugubrious and justified by the hallucinatory poisoning, while from ""The Shining"" we know how an uncanny sensation can also be generated by an antithetical form. But there is a subplot that becomes prevalent, a post-war period drama that abandons the area adjacent to Conan Doyle and Poe to move to the vicinity of Baudelaire and of a cursed fiercely anti-family-friendly ""malheur"", as if the director had concealed behind the masks of Christie and Poirot his other referent, Shakespeare with one of his epic tragedies between blood relatives.'), ('7', ""This was an interesting and unique tale.

Writing credits go to Joby Harold, Darnell Metayer, Josh Peters, Erich Hoeber, and Jon Hoeber. During the ‘90s, a new faction of Transformers – the Maximals – join the Autobots as allies in the battle for Earth. THINGS I LIKED: The cast is fantastic and includes Anthony Ramos (I love him!), Ron Perlman (voice), Academy Award winner Michelle Yeoh (voice), Pete Davidson (voice), Dominique Fishback, and young Dean Scott Vazquez. The lead characters’ stories immediately make you want to root for them. The emotional connection between the Transformers is also significant. You get action from the very first scene and plenty more later on. Impressive set pieces. Lots of humor. Not all of it lands, but I appreciated the effort. Poppin music. We get to go to Peru! The luscious, green landscapes mixed with terraced stones and wide fields make for the perfect backdrop and setting for more battle sequences. Throw in a little bit of Inca legend, and you’ve got something interesting. If you’ve ever seen the TV series “Beast Wars: Transformers (1996), then you’ll recognize the Maximals, which can transform into animals. Optimus Prime is a 1987 Freightliner FLA semi-truck in this movie. There are some entertaining, new robots that are immediately likeable. Shout-out to New York City grit. Compared to the Michael Bay movies that had dizzying, grinding action sequences that were too close-up to see well, I thought the direction of this film was much better. The last few Transformer movies were real stinkers, but this one worked, cliched as it was. The CGI is very good. We get a LOT of different kinds of Transformers. The ending lets you know you’re not going to have to wait too long for a sequel to this story. Yep, the Transformers franchise is not dead. THINGS I DIDN’T LIKE: Because they have to keep reinventing worlds, there is, necessarily, a LOT of exposition so the audience can understand what’s going on. So much explaining! It always makes me laugh when the Transformers have massive battles out in the open, yet no other humans see or hear anything. The plot is extremely simple, sandwiched by lots of battles and destruction. Some of the story details are filled with predictable tropes and others don’t make sense but try not to overthink everything and you’ll enjoy it just fine. If you don’t like Transformer movies to begin with, don’t bother with this one. Some fans are loving this new addition, but it’s probably not going to convince you otherwise. There’s a short scene when Dominique Fishback starts to sing and I was REALLY hoping that Anthony Ramos would sing with her, but he doesn’t. Missed opportunity! I absolutely loved him in Hamilton and In the Heights. He is so talented! First, Optimus Prime. Now, Optimus Primal. Seriously? It felt a lot like the very first Transformers movie but without the novelty. TIPS FOR PARENTS: A mother swears and her son scolds her saying, “Language!” There is some additional, “mild” profanity. Some Spanish is spoken without subtitles. One line is crude. Lots of destruction. Lots of violence and fighting. People and creatures are in dangerous situations.

The writing is not up to much but but it somehow didn't iritate me in the way that it did in e.g. Avatar WoW.

I did not watch a trailer or read anything about it before seeing it in theaters, this would prove to be a huge mistake. I went to see it because I liked the show Beast Wars as a kid. Lets get straight to the point. This movie is bad. Its even more focused on humans than the Michael bay films. The first half of the movie is basically slow woke pandering *ahem* I mean ""developing"" the two main human characters which are both uninteresting flat racial caricatures. Now that that\'s out of the way this movie introduces a new type of Transformer, unfortunately they are barely in the movie; in fact Cheetor and Rhinox have like one line each. There is also a lack of Villain Transformers (only 3) who likewise are not fleshed out at all beyond being evil. I couldn\'t even tell you their names after watching the movie. Perhaps the biggest flaw of all is that there is barely any robot fight scenes in a movie about fighting robots. Instead we get a lot of action scenes that cater to a specific audience and focus on human protagonists. There are realistically only 2 major transformer fight scenes in the movie. One towards the beginning, and one at the end. The second is the finale which is the ONLY TIME the Maximals transform. Their transformations look good too, which leaves you wondering why this was not a bigger focal point of the movie. Yet even in the finale, in the big reveal of their transformations when they finally get to say the iconic line of ""Maximize!"" they still barely get any screen time. Instead we largely focus on the humans again with a splash of Mirage/Optimus Prime thrown in. There is also a weird forced representation in the Autobots who now have a female who never does much of anything and one with a latino accent yet doesn\'t speak Spanish. This accent is used for one joke; other than that this character is totally impotent and irrelevant. A lot could be said about how bad this movie is, and how much wasted potential there was within it. What leaves you feeling jaded is the realization they wasted your time on purpose with the classic bait and switch.'), ('3', '""Transformers: Rise of the Beasts"" seems like a promising title but unfortunately proves to be the contrary.

I\'ve seen these controlled messes before and sometimes they work (Synechdoche NY by Kaufman) and sometimes they just fall flat on their faces (Cloud Atlas by Wachowskis). You gotta admire the depth Aster goes into on this big fat metaphors and slices of life condensed. Lot\'s of great Oedipal metaphors, mixed with \'seize the day\' moods.

And also at the end of the day, we have to remember that we\'re dealing with a horror director here. So it\'s not quite as ""heady"" as it looks. But we\'ve got some fabulous editing, great mixed media, a different kind of Phoenix shows up for this one, more subdued and quirky than ever, with a supporting cast that does just that, and does it well. Like I said, I would love to give this film a 9. And were it directed or re-written by someone like Charlie Kaufman, maybe it\'d get there?

The film was written and directed by the extremely creative Ari Aster. The film is brought to us by A24, a studio known for its unusual work. THINGS I LIKED: The movie had me at Joaquin Phoenix. He’s amazing and deserves all of the many awards he has received over the years. The terrific cast also includes Tony Award winner Nathan Lane, Amy Ryan, Parker Posey, Tony and Grammy award-winning Patti LuPone, and Zoe Lister-Jones. Director Aster definitely plays the long game with his films. While watching his mindblowing film Midsommar, I was bewildered, shocked, and horrified. In the end, I realized it was extremely clever, although it’s definitely not a movie for everyone’s taste. In this movie, Aster wants the audience to experience what it feels like to live with paranoid, emotional trauma. If you enjoy Charlie Kaufman’s surrealistic style of art, you’ll be intrigued by this film. Otherwise, this is an unusual movie that simply won’t resonate with most viewers. THINGS I DIDN’T LIKE: The director took WAY too long to say what he wanted to say. This is a very long, tiring film. The director described the film as a 4-hour nightmare. It certainly feels like 4 hours but is just under 3 hours, which is still too long and a test of an audience’s endurance, hoping for something amazing to happen. The film is confusing, indulgent, and strange. For me, it was painful to watch, knowing I could spend my time in better ways. Sure, I get the artsy-fartsy pieces and messages, but that doesn’t mean it’s my cup of tea. The music and sound effects were often both hypnotic and annoying. There really isn’t a huge plot; the movie is strung together by experiences that are designed to make you feel a variety of emotions.

Nora is twelve years old and has a crush on her classmate Hae Song. Unfortunately for the burgeoning romance, Nora’s parents have decided to leave Seoul and immigrate to Canada. Twelve years later, Nora and Hae Song reconnect through the miracle of social media. Their relationship becomes a series of video calls where the sense of connection is palpable. Eventually though, Nora decides that they should stop talking for a while; she wants to focus on career opportunities in her new home town of New York City. Another twelve years later, Hae Song decides to vacation in New York City. It’s an opportunity for him to see a now-married Nora face-to-face for the first time in twenty-four years. It’s all sweet, sad and thoughtful. In the process, this film offers more observations about the human condition than any film in recent memory. Several elements make this film outstanding. The cast is pitch perfect. As the adult Nora, Greta Lee (“The Morning Show,” “Russian Doll,” Will Aronson’s musical “My Scary Girl”) is mesmerizing. She blends her well-honed comic timing with a sincerity and vulnerability that are irresistible. As Hae Song, Teo Yoo (“Leto,” “Decision to Leave”) is equally impressive. You can often read his emotions without a word having to be spoken. John Magaro (“The Big Short,” “First Cow”) has a smaller but still essential role as Nora’s husband, Arthur. In one of the best film scenes in recent memory, Nora and Hae Song are in a bar speaking in animated Korean while Arthur sits patiently, uncomfortably beside her. Clearly, this is a film that could have gone in a million different directions. Song deftly uses her story to explore a variety of themes – the nature of relationships, the immigrant experience, the necessary balance between work and relationships, the role of fate (and the Korean concept of “in-yun”). She does it all in an unhurried style that makes “Past Lives” feel similar to Richard Linklater’s “Before” trilogy. It’s my guess this film will be equally well-loved and critically regarded. What’s most surprising here is Song’s self-confidence as a first-time filmmaker, given that she has the additional responsibility of being true to her own story. Many of the story elements of “Past Lives” are autobiographical. Song emigrated from Korea to Canada at age 12. She, like Nora, is a playwright. She currently lives in New York City with a husband she met on a writer’s retreat, like her character. Realizing and respecting the power of her story, Song infuses this film with an unhurried pace that allows real emotions to develop and well-earned insights to come to the surface. Song has the self-confidence to highlight the power of words left unspoken. She uses her technique to convey the insurmountable gulf between two characters who, paradoxically, are standing two feet apart. Like many of the best films, “Past Lives” will serve as an incentive for self-reflection for many moviegoers. You’ll leave the theater pondering the arc of your own story and the crucial “what-ifs” that have affected your own journey. “Past Lives” is a powerful, evocative experience for any moviegoer with a beating heart.'), ('7', 'Good storyline, characters and setting.'), ('9', ""It's been quite a while since my theater was left in completely silent shock by the end.""), ('9', 'When a movie this simple works this well, hard to complain about anything.

THINGS I LIKED: I attended a press screener at a theater for a different movie where the trailer for Renfield showed. The audience was fairly quiet at the beginning, but as soon as Nicolas Cage appeared on the big screen, the entire audience burst out in delighted laughter. Without his over-the-top, ridiculous performance, this movie wouldn’t be nearly as entertaining as it is. He said that playing Dracula was a lifelong dream of his. He played a vampire in one of his earlier movies back in the 1980s, Vampire’s Kiss, so I guess you could say that this kind of role is in his BLOOD. ha ha The entertaining cast also includes Nicholas Hoult, Awkwafina, Ben Schwartz, Adrian Martinez, Brandon Scott Jones, Miles Doleac, and Shohreh Aghdashloo. They all do an excellent job. I wonder if it got confusing on filming days to have two leading men named Nicolas (Cage and Hoult). If nothing else, it’s a new take on the old story of Dracula. Director Chris McKay explained that he wanted this movie to be a sequel to Tod Browning’s Dracula in 1931! The marketing was supposed to reflect that connection, but it didn’t actually work. The castle seen in the movie is the same one used in the family-friendly movie Chitty-Chitty Bang Bang! It’s called Neuschwanstein, located in Bavaria, Germany. Guess what? Nicholas Cage actually owns a few castles in real life! It’s a pulp version of vampires with a lot of dark humor and comedic schtick. It’s also extremely campy, so be prepared. Shout-out to Wiccan Tumblr. Ha ha The themes and life lessons are simple and powerful. THINGS I DIDN’T LIKE: The film is extremely violent and gory. There are quite a few dark scenes at night that will make viewing difficult when watched on a small streaming device. The ending is vague enough that it leaves a crack open for a sequel.

Margaret's conflict, uneasy about not knowing if she is Jewish or Catholic, alludes to the spiritual search many of us have undertaken at some point in our lives. Fremon Craig gets it right in showing how religion can bring out the best and worst in us.

The first half of the film is more interesting and credible, as it precisely develops the micro-violence that a woman has to endure both at home and in her workplace.

The picture might be more worth watching if the two protagonists (Phoebe Dynevor, Alden Ehrenreich) weren’t so inherently deplorable and portrayed with some of the hammiest on-screen acting I’ve seen in a long time.

Fair Play is an allegory about the dynamics of power embedded in a context of excessive wealth and ambition. It is about a ruthless capitalist world that mercilessly crushes anyone too weak to stand up to it. Telling a romantic story between two people involved in that world and working in the same hedge fund implies dealing with more than just ordinary moments of love. From the trailer, it can be anticipated that one of the central points of this plot lies in how business corrupts the lives of the main characters and how those around them, especially the female protagonist, consider others as mere disposable objects. Hence the quote I chose. The resulting dynamic between the two immediately generates feelings of resentment when she is promoted, and he is not. One begins to fall behind, and in this context, the plot development, although predictable due to the fact that it is rare for a man to tolerate his partner surpassing his work and economic achievements, whether for reasons of ego or self-esteem, suggests that the relationship has become a ticking time bomb, we just have to wait for the explosion. Admittedly, I feel that Fair Play could have addressed the tensions between the business processes and the power relations and gender in a more focused way rather than concentrating mostly on the conflict of the protagonists' relationship. Nevertheless, generally speaking, I found the film to be competent. However, it lost a full star due to its weak resolution and the lack of nuance and experience in the performances of its actors.

Mia Goth, as always, delivers a chilling performance as a twisted woman completely given to her wildest side. Salute or new horror queen! I wish we'd known more about the sci-fi concept of the film — the doppelgangers — because it's very intriguing. Unfortunately, Brandon Cronenberg's screenplay gets messier as the story goes by, and the plot gets tedious by the second part. Some thoughts are very in-your-face, and the graphic images are there only for shock value most of the time. But hey, at least the trippy sequences are cool; they reminded me of the Panos Cosmatos 'Cabinet of Curiosities' episode. Also, the upper-class critique theme is oversaturated by now. We've had no shortage of these films or series in the last couple of years, and lots of them have been notably superficial. 'Infinity Pool' offers a no conventional take on the subject — although the representation of the locals as bloodthirsty individuals in rags is up to debate — but it gets underdeveloped when the writer/director starts to follow another thread, which is another problem the movie has; many ideas feel undercooked. Either way, I hope Cronenberg continues to explore the darkest and sickest corners of the human condition, but more in a 'Possessor' kind of way.""), ('7', ""Infinity Pool is a film that proudly wears its strange and surreal nature on its sleeve.

As the story unfolds, we witness a couple, James and Em Foster, getting swept up in a maelstrom of body horror, twisted power dynamics, and surreal imagery that threatens to consume them entirely. The film's direction is a major strength, as Brandon Cronenberg shows signs of inheriting his father's talent for crafting visceral and unsettling visual experiences. The camera is unflinching in its depictions of extreme violence and surreal bodily modifications, yet always maintains an artistic and dreamlike aura. Cleopatra Coleman and Alexander Skarsgård deliver convincing and empathetic performances, grounding the film's increasingly bizarre narrative with moments of genuine emotion and vulnerability. With that being said, Infinity Pool is not for everyone. Its commitment to being strange and provocative can be challenging for some viewers. However, for those willing to take the plunge and immerse themselves in the film's twisted world, they will be rewarded with a uniquely imaginative and unforgettable cinematic experience.

He’s been willing to portray unappealing characters and to take big risks with the roles he’s played. Recently, he’s been an abusive husband in TV’s “Big Little Lies,” an amoral tech CEO (I know, redundant, right?) on “Succession” and a Viking prince with anger management issues in the film “The Northman.” His role here may be his most challenging to date. In Writer/Director Brandon Cronenberg’s “Infinity Pool,” James (Skarsgård) and his wife are vacationing at La Tolqa, a fictional beachfront resort. After publishing a single, poorly-received book six years ago, James is seeking inspiration. The couple encounters Gabi (Mia Goth) and Alban, who invite them on a trip outside the compound, even though it’s strictly forbidden. Driving back drunk, James hits and kills a local resident. He’s arrested and taken by the police to a sober, concrete, Soviet-style police station where he’s presented with a choice. He can be executed for his capital crime. Or, for a hefty fee, he can be cloned and have his double die in his place. After that, the movie gets weird. As with his first film “Possessor,” Cronenberg demonstrates his skill as a provocateur. The opening visual, where the camera rotates 360 degrees, informs us early that what’s to come will be disorienting. People wear grotesque masks. They engage in orgies, although they’re more psychedelic than explicit. This is a film that’s disturbing, bewildering, upsetting and disgusting but also thought-provoking. What works here is the acting. Skarsgård shows his versatility as James (and one or two of his clones). After starring in this year’s “Pearl” and “X,” Mia Goth uses this project to solidify her status as the latest scream queen. She’s particularly skillful at compellingly portraying unhinged maniacs. What doesn’t occur is adequate development of the many themes Cronenberg addresses in the film. He clearly disdains the entitlement of rich Western travelers who inflict themselves on some of the world’s poorest but most beautiful countries. But his critique of privilege is neither as well-focused nor as insightful as what we’ve already seen in “Parasite,” “The Menu” or even “Glass Onion.” He swings and misses when given the opportunity to address the nature of humanness in the context of clones. Where he connects most powerfully is when he proposes that humans will sink to their worst instincts and impulses when placed in a world where their actions have no consequences. In 1996’s “Crash,” Writer/Director David Cronenberg, Brandon’s father, explored a subculture of people physically disfigured in car crashes. In “Infinity Pool,” Brandon Cronenberg is clearly interested in exploring a less obvious disfigurement: events that warp the psyche and damage if not obliterate the soul.'), ('2', ""The film is one of the worst of 2023 so far, the only thing that saves it is Mia Goth's performance, since the script did not please me, photography, montage everything is so weak and boring I will never see this film again.""), ('7', ""With The White Lotus, The Menu and Triangle of Sadness still fresh in our minds, the moment we meet rich and bored James and Em at a posh resort, introduced in a rotating, disorienting fashion, we know things won't go well.

Cronenburg continues to examine what makes us, us. And starts to put that in a blender, so to speak. It's an original, fascinating concept that gets into Ken Russell tripiness at times, but is a wild ride.""), ('6', 'Interest 6/10 Characters 6.5/10 Cinematography/Set 8/10 Story 4.5/10 Acting 6/10')}"
Elemental,"Jun 16, 2023",1 h 41 m,58,5.5,"{('8', 'IN A NUTSHELL: I had the delightful privilege of watching this movie in a press screener in a theater filled with kids and their parents. It was insightful to hear their reactions and see which parts of the movie were their favorites. At the end of the movie, the audience clapped enthusiastically. The movie features a land of animated characters that are either earth, wind, fire, or water. Lessons are learned about life and love. The movie was directed by Peter Sohn. The writing team includes John Hoberg, Kat Likkel, Brenda Hsueh, and director Peter Sohn. The director has explained that the movie is based on his life as an immigrant, moving to the USA from Korea. THINGS I LIKED: The cast of voice talents did a fantastic job: Leah Lewis, Mamoudou Athie, Ronnie Del Carmen, Shila Ommi, Wendi McLendon-Covey, Catherine O’Hara, and more! The color palette of this animation is bright and energetic. The world-building is quite clever and entertaining. Because the pandemic prevented the art team from visiting a bunch of countries, they watched a lot of movies about Amsterdam and Venice for inspiration. I love both of those cities! There is so much visual and spoken humor, especially after Act 1. If you watch this in theaters, you’ll get to see a new short called “Carl’s Date” about Carl, the old man in the darling movie UP. Surprisingly, it’s been 5 years since Pixar has shown a short before one of their films! The animation, as expected, is excellent. The water, especially looks amazing. Pixar bought more computers in order to make this movie, filling three rooms on the studio campus with over 151,000 cores! The movie took 7 years to make. Wow! Because of the pandemic, the story team and animators had to work from home during the quarantine to keep the project moving forward. I love it when a movie gives you so many details to sink your teeth into. Sometimes, the details provide important insights, but sometimes they just entertain you in a specific frame. One example is a character who simply walks by wearing a T-shirt that says, “Kiss me. I’m Fireish.” ha ha The names of the characters were clever and really matched their element theme. For example, the main water character’s name is Wade. Believe it or not, when I was in Kindergarten, there was a boy in my twin sister’s class whose name was Wade A. Shore. His sister’s name was Sandy. I’m not even kidding! Pay close attention to the nature of each of the elements and how they’re represented. For example, the main fire girl, Ember, is very hot-tempered and needs to control her anger. I love how her nose moves like a flame would. Thomas Newman’s musical score perfectly adds the bounce and drama to each scene. Keep watching during the final, rolling credits. There are some cute images that extend the story a bit further. I love Wade’s emotionally-free family. They easily shared laughs and tears together. They were also immediately accepting of Ember (the fire girl) and quickly accommodated her unique needs. I love that Disney showed such a kind, healthy family, since so many Disney movies feature dysfunctional families. They say that the director actually teared up when the movie wrapped, something that Wade would do for sure! One of the characters in the movie is named Ghibli to honor the Japanese animation studio Ghibli. When I took my family to Japan, we were able to visit Studio Ghibli. It was as awesome as you would hope it to be. THINGS I DIDN’T LIKE: The movie took quite a while to get started. The audience didn’t laugh for about 20 minutes but eventually reacted enthusiastically. We don’t get to know all of the elements. We see land and wind, but the movie really focuses on water and fire. Have you ever noticed that the men in movies are often portrayed as carefree and fun, while the women are uptight and serious? Such is the case with the leading couple in this movie. In 2006, the Walt Disney Corporation purchased Pixar Animation Studios. Does that mean Pixar has now gone woke? This movie definitely has some messaging about that. At the surface, the themes of the movie featured problem-solving, standing up for one’s self, and love: all good messages. I know there will be parents who disprove of an ulterior agenda that promotes the “me first” philosophy. So many children’s movies in recent years have shown duty and responsibility as a negative thing so much so that being selfish appears as a superior attitude. TIPS FOR PARENTS: No profanity. In fact, they used theme-related words instead. For example, the audience laughed when someone said “ash” instead of “ass.” The mother (Cinder Lumen) is a fortune teller. There is some talk of “hanky panky.” When 2 characters shared a romantic kiss, almost every kid in the audience I sat with groaned and moaned.'), ('9', 'The old magic of Pixar returns in this family delight, and I am sad this was not a bigger hit. At the heart of this amazing movie is a timeless love story, of two elementally different individuals seeing the light shining in each other and coming together against all odds. My family and I were swept away by the simple sweetness of this film. Director Peter Sohn has done well. There is also a beautiful father-daughter story interwoven into this film, and as the father of 4 princesses, I can definitely relate. The timeless lesson of letting your kids follow their dreams is retold in a beautiful way, and even more so, the critical importance of parent and child respecting each other. The animation is spectacular, I love how the various elements are represented, and how they interact with each other in various moments. The character design is spot on, and the closer you look the more details emerge. Hats off to how far Pixar animation has come. For some time I thought a 5th unifying element would emerge but that was wishful thinking. Finally, the soundtrack is a real delight, I truly appreciate the South Asian themes as my region of origin.

The film was directed by Adele Lim. She also helped write the screenplay with Cherry Chevapravatdumrong, and Teresa Hsiao. On a personal note, I\'ve been to China many times and love it there! I took two of my sons with me when I went on my first speaking tour. We all fell in love with the people and culture. One of them even married a lovely woman from Hong Kong and now I have an adorable grandson with Chinese in his blood! THINGS I LIKED: I\'m so happy to see Ashley Park in a feature film! I love her in the popular sitcom Emily in Paris. She\'s so talented and beautiful. Other cast members include Debbie Fan, Kenneth Liu, Annie Mumolo, David Denman, and more. There is a sweet storyline about one of the characters going to find her birth mother, yet also recognizing that her adoptive parents are amazing. It\'s fun to go to China in the movie! It\'s a beautiful country filled with rich culture, delicious food, and gentle people. THINGS I DIDN\'T LIKE: The girls are SO crude and vulgar. Why do feminists think the only way to show they are liberated is to be crass and foul? One of the girls states about the Chinese people that ""People around here can tell Chinese-Chinese from American-Chinese."" That\'s so true because Chinese-Chinese people don\'t wear loud, obnoxious colors for the most part or wear Hipster-American clothing. Chinese people are much more reserved and respectful. Characters in the movie slam white people, Americans, Chinese, Christians, and other things. Honestly, this felt like a rated X movie, so I stopped watching it long before it ended. It\'s soooo raunchy and filled with slutty tramps who respect nothing. TIPS FOR PARENTS: This sex-obsessed movie is not appropriate for kids. Lots of profanity and SO many F-bombs. The first word we hear in the movie is an F-bomb. The first word we hear a young child say is an F-bomb. It\'s supposed to be so funny, but it\'s certainly not clever. Young girls flip the bird SO many times. We see sexualized artwork that features male genitalia. Young women talk about sex and genitalia many, many, many times. Mandarin is spoken a lot, mostly with subtitles that have to be read. Lots of alcohol. A bunch of young women do cocaine and hide bags of it in their bodies. We see several people going at it in a variety of ways.'), ('4', ""The film has some moments of effective humor, and genuine chemistry between the leads.

It’s the kind of fun action movie you want to watch while eating buttery popcorn and one that’s filled with cliches and plot holes, yet still an entertaining ride. Critics are calling it vapid, but audiences are loving it. Sit back, put your sense of reality in the locked position, and enjoy your flight! This action-packed flick was directed by Jean-Francois Richet who gives us lots of high-octane moments. The screenplay is by J.P. Davis and Charles Cumming. TIPS FOR PARENTS: Lots of brutal, bloody violence High dead-body count Guns, knives, and hand-to-hand combat People are in perilous situations Tagalog is spoken with subtitles Hostages THINGS I LIKED: Gerard Butler is perfect in this role. He knows how to roll with tension, action, and heart. He sure takes a beating in this one. Another name was pushed for by the studio, but Gerard Butler liked the simple title of Plane. Fun fact: The movie was actually filmed in Puerto Rico, not in Singapore or the Philippines as it states in the actual film. There’s a nice balance of action and time to breathe in between the shoot-em-up scenes. If you already don’t like to fly, this movie will terrify you some more.While the entire movie isn’t shot as a one-take movie, there are some moments that are. I always love the choreography of shots like that. The impressive camerawork is noticeable because there isn’t much CGI. It kind of felt like a fun Die Hard movie where you just can’t overthink anything in order to have a good time. THINGS I DIDN’T LIKE: There are a couple of subplot lines that don’t necessarily go anywhere other than to distract and entertain us. There are some dumb moments that will remind you of 90s action movies, but you’re still going to have fun. The villains are paper-thin and cliched.'), ('6', 'If your plane is going to crashland on an Island even the nearby governments are too afraid to go near, well then it’s a good thing your pilot is Gerard Butler. Brodie Torrance (Gerard Butler) is a pilot, a father and only delighted to be on his way home to his daughter for New Years after one last flight. Well on what should have been a routine flight ends badly during a lightning strike and they are forced to “land” on a war torn Island. Better than landing on the water right? Wrong, turns out from all the places they could have landed, the Island is filled with dangerous rebels practically queuing up to get shot and battered by Gerard Butler. Turns out “the crash was just the beginning.” Gerard Butler must now find a way to get help while also protected the passengers from these dangerous criminals. Plane is a mindless action flick that writes itself, offers no real surprises but is entertaining in the moment and does the job. It’s fast paced, wastes absolutely no time getting going and is just an all-round fun movie. There’s also enough time allowed to set up the characters before things go south so you’re invested enough in the story to care what happens. The fight scenes are very well shot, none of this over the top shaky cam stuff. It’s actually clear to see each and every vicious punch to the head. It’s not exactly going to go down in history as one of the best action movies ever made but it’s enjoyable all the same. Pretty sure the only reason anyone is seeing Plane is for Gerard Butler. It’s definitely one of his better movies, and believe me I’ve seen some of his worst ones (yeah I’m looking at you Gods of Egypt), so when I say Plane is a decent movie you can trust me. If there’s one thing cinemas will never be short of is an action star thrown into a perilous situation and must save the day before it’s too late. Plane is actually what it advertises, no more and no less. If you’re looking for something different to all the award contenders right now, then look no further, Plane has you covered. Highly recommended for all the diehard Gerard Butler fans.'), ('6', 'Gerard Butler’s an interesting guy. He studied law at the University of Glasgow, but was reportedly fired from his first law firm one week after getting his law license. After establishing himself as an actor, Butler created a production company (it’s now called G-Base Productions) which bankrolls all of his movies. The company’s first commercial success was “Olympus Has Fallen.” It was soon followed by “London Has Fallen” and “Angel Has Fallen.” The company has no known relationship with Life Alert. G-Base’s current offering is “Plane.” Like the movie’s title, the film is a stripped-down, bare bones action film. There are no elaborate set pieces. There’s no extraneous dialogue. The main character has no love interest. Turns out, it’s satisfyingly self-sufficient. Main character a pilot. Plane flies into storm. Plane loses power. Beverage service discontinued. Plane crash-lands in jungle. Good news: plane intact, passengers survive. Bad news: island overrun by ruthless rebel militia. Passengers captured. Pilot must rescue passengers. Entertainingly predictable action ensues. There’s absolutely nothing new here. The story centers on two main characters. Veteran Captain Brodie Torrance (Butler) is flying for a low-rent airline after being caught on video choking out an unruly passenger. He is square-jawed, stoic, but also prone to introspection, of course in a totally manly way. When trying to rescue the passengers, Brodie is led/helped by Louis Gaspare (Mike Colter – “Jessica Jones,” title role in “Luke Cage”). In a surprising development, Gaspare is not a mustache-twirling Frenchman, but a formidable-looking, manacled prisoner convicted of capital murder who once served in the French Foreign Legion. Mon dieu. Both actors are excellent. There’s something refreshing about a movie willing to just do simple things well. Here, the creative team is self-confident enough to tell a story without diversion, subterfuge or distracting subplots and to still believe their effort will satisfy the audience. In other words, welcome to the 1990s. Think of “Plane” as furthering the tradition of “Con Air” and “Air Force One.” That’s not to say the finished product is flawless. At one point, Brodie voluntarily goes to the captors and offers himself in place of the captured passengers. It’s a little too messianic. But perhaps this airline has created a frequent flyer program where loyalty works both ways. If you’re looking for two hours of pleasant diversion, this film is strongly recommended. It’s ideal for the moviegoer who found “Top Gun: Maverick” a little too complicated.'), ('7', 'Good story. Good action. Good side story. Good acting.

I thought Plane would be no different, especially when I viewed the trailer. But yet again, I was surprised with the warm reception the film got and on Monday, I made it a point to go and watch this film. Suffice to say, just like the rest, I was surprised and impressed as well. Plane isn't just an action film. It is a thriller as well and all in all a good entertainer. Of course I am not giving away any spoilers but from what the trailer shows, it is a story centered around a Airplane Pilot Brodie Torrance (Gerard Butler) and what unfolds on new year's eve with him and his passengers and crew. The 1st half of the film is a pure thrill ride and it keeps you glued to your seat, although you know what is going to happen, you still want to see it unfold. You might think that the 2nd half of the film is gonna be a Rambo-like film but actually it isn't which is a good thing and honestly a great approach to a predictable plot. Performance wise, of course it is Gerard Butler who is the star of the show, since the entire story revolves around his character. After him it is Mike Colter who has done a good job although, he doesn't have much to do accept beat up the bad guys. The Supporting cast and do their adequate best in their respective roles. Charles Cumming and J. P. Davis who have written the script should be acknowledged because Plane is a film you go in expecting the same-old, same-old action madness but you come out satisfied because it isn't that. Director Jean-François Richet has done a good job 'merging' two genres into one. Kudos to him for this attempt and waiting to see more from him. In conclusion, Plane is a good entertainer because it tries to be different and for that I give it accolades. Go for it if you like Pure-Popcorn-Entertainment.""), ('3', ""Very stupid screenplay! Could have been much better and more realistic for a 2023 movie! Watchable, if there's nothing else.""), ('6', ""Gerard Butler plays a pilot whose plane has a forced landing on a remote island ruled by warring rebels. There are actually 2 movies here: The flight, which is pretty gripping, and the fight, which is standard action fare. There's tension building up to the emergency landing, but once they arrive in the jungle the threats become human and not especially intimidating. The rescue attempt has lots of gunfire, but not much else. Once you've experienced the entire movie, the absurdity of the premise becomes even more ridiculous. Still, it's a passable but quickly forgotten action flight.""), ('7', 'I enjoyed it - it had action, it had real settings, it had story which could be real for most of it and it was interesting to watch throughout.

Directed by Justine Triet, this French film is at first glance a rather typical courtroom procedural drama. And while this is rather true in some senses, it also takes some interesting and unexpected turns, particularly in the latter half of the film as things become more clear and apparent with the trial and everything leading up to it. And while I felt as though it played things relatively safe and pedestrian for the most part, the story remains compelling enough in its own right, and Huller gives an absolute tour de force performance here. Even the young boy playing her son here also has some solid moments to shine in the film's second half in particular. Overall, it's a rather standard courtroom procedural, but some of the unexpected turns it takes midway through, along with the stellar performances from all involved make this one a worthwhile enough watch.

Lastly and more importantly ==== SPOILER ALER ===== there was never any doubt whatsoever what the verdict would be and that\'s a problem. Without having that tension, the film became longer than necessary and ultimately didn\'t lead to any big surprise endings. Perhaps those sorts of endings are too ""American?""

Film buffs, be sure to add this to your watchlist, it’s a 2023 film not to be missed. Sandra (Sandra Hüller), her husband Samuel (Samuel Theis) and their son Daniel (Milo Machado Graner) live in a remote town in the French Alps. Their house is in a picturesque but very secluded location. When Samuel is found dead in the snow the police start their investigation and they quickly begin to question whether he was murdered or if he committed suicide. Sandra becomes the main suspect and a court case that initially appears as “did she really kill her husband?” goes much, much deeper. Delving headfirst into their complicated marriage, scrutinising every detail under the legal system and putting it on display for everyone to see. Anatomy of a Fall is part murder mystery, part courtroom drama and all tense crime thriller. It’s a brilliantly written story that gradually reels you in and will keep you guessing until the very end. It brings you on a psychological journey from start to finish and deals with complex relationships and how events and conversations can be interpreted. It’s so realistic and engrossing and at times feels like a true crime story. The details of the case are revealed piece by piece like a jigsaw puzzle while very effectively making you feel like you’re right there sitting in the courtroom watching the events unfold. Courtroom dramas are generally crowd pleasers, although many go way beyond reality. Anatomy of a Fall feels so genuine and chilling. Not going for the shouty outbursts or shock value, it moves along at a slow pace while also packed full of emotion from Sandra Hüller every second she’s on screen. As the viewer you’re right there in the middle of it, unsure whether she did or didn’t do it. A film that relies mainly on conversations needs a great script and the right people for the roles. Sandra Hüller as the widow standing trial and Milo Machado Graner as her son are two of the best performances I’ve seen all year. It’s all tied together with a captivating script and the whole film is a lesson on how to make a courtroom drama. Anatomy of a Fall is a gripping and engaging film by Justine Triet.

You Hurt My Feelings,"May 26, 2023",1 h 33 m,80,6.3,"{('6', '“You Hurt My Feelings” is an inspired title. It effectively summarizes all the action that takes place in the course of this film, while simultaneously capturing what’s at stake here. Beth (Julia Louis-Dreyfus – “Veep,” “Seinfeld”) has been laboring to write a novel, a follow-up to her modestly well-received memoir. Her husband Don (Tobias Menzies – Prince Philip in “The Crown”) has read twenty drafts of the novel, offering vague encouragement following each reading. Beth overhears Don telling a friend that he really didn’t like his wife’s novel. Beth is distraught. What follows is a meditation on “little white lies.” Is superficial lying a necessary lubricant for human relationships, as some have proposed? Alternatively, are truly solid relationships built on an unfaltering honesty in which any form of untruth has no place? It’s an interesting question. Regrettably, even through the final scene of this film, Writer/Director Nicole Holofcener steadfastly refuses to take a position. “You Hurt My Feelings” includes several positive elements that make the film worth seeing. Holofcener’s script includes keenly-observed, rich female characters. (The males here are not so fortunate.) At times, the dialogue crackles with cleverness. And the cast is first-rate. Julia Louis-Dreyfus is multi-dimensional, compelling and appealing as a character who doesn’t rely on the self-absorbed snark she deployed constantly in “Veep.” Michaela Watkins, an alumna along with Louis-Dreyfus of Holofcener’s previous film “Enough Said,” is excellent as Sarah, Beth’s sister. Arian Moayed (“Succession,” “Inventing Anna”) is outstanding as Sarah’s husband, a tortured actor who is mesmerized by socks. Professional critics have adored this film, bestowing upon it the ultimate accolade of “grown-up movie,” presumably since “adult film” was already taken. This seems a fair assessment, since young adults will have little or no tolerance for its nothing-at-stake “action” and children will sleep through the proceedings. Overall, “You Hurt My Feelings” is a story about people who have the luxury to fixate on incidents, not real crises. They are New Yorkers who vacillate between oblivious self-absorption and an awareness of others that inevitably generates neurotic anxiety. In other words, for better or worse, you’re likely to feel as if you’ve been suddenly thrown into an old Woody Allen movie. If you want to see all of this done better, re-watch “Annie Hall.”'), ('2', ""American indie film hits 60, and hasn't improved with age.

Dreyfuss and Menzies make for such a charming pair on screen, and their chemistry is undeniable, with some other humorous and worthwhile appearances from other notable faces, such as real-life married acting couple David Cross and Amber Tamblyn.

Poker Face (2023),"Jan 26, 2023",2 Seasons,84,6.5,"{('8', '(Ep 1 ""Dead Man\'s Hand"" + Ep 2 ""The Night Shift"") A waitress named Charlie with a gift for detecting deception gets recruited by a casino boss to exploit a high-roller\'s poker game, while she deals with her friend\'s violent murder. Charlie then hits the road, but finds herself poking around the apparent wrongful arrest of a helpful trucker she meets at a remote rest stop. Charlie is played by Natasha Lyonne as a Columbo-type sleuth who is also a self-described dumbass. Like Columbo she is usually an apologetic and unthreatening interrogator, but unlike Columbo you know that sometimes she is not just PLAYING dumb. She keeps stumbling into obstacles or solutions without knowing how or if she can master or learn from the experience. The nominal hook for the series is Charlie\'s seemingly infallible gift for smelling out intentionally deceptive utterances. That ability gets less focus in the initial episodes than one might expect, and is downplayed by Charlie herself as a source of frustration and confusion.I expect from Rian Johnston\'s past screenwriting that POKER FACE will eventually mine the premise for clever twists and payoffs. However, that isn’t strongly evident in the openering stories. They presumably have to focus more on establishing the character and the series\' plot arc. These lean engaging and clear mystery/crime storytelling that is still pretty conventional. If anything, POKER FACE is more distinguished by how Charlie\'s amateur investigator status lends dramatic weight to her personal confrontations with perpetrators. This show is a great vehicle for Natasha Lyonne\'s anti-glamorous screen persona as a bed-headed working-class day-drinker. She gets the best moments in the episodes viewed: an excited off-screen reaction to a luxurious private chamber; and a charming delivery of the line, ""I\'m gonna... accept this situation."": her bemused reaction to waking up somewhere unexpected. A low-expectations attitude to her abilities and to looming threats make her an exception to the variously committed and well-resourced law-enforcement and P.I. types who populate crime shows. It makes it harder for writers to insert high stakes into her stories, but it does make her more relatable. By default she wants to ignore people\'s lies and manipulations and avoid involvement, but she is torn by the impulse to keep poking her nose where it is not welcome because something just doesn\'t feel right. Rather than being a crime buster straight out of the gate, she is going to have to learn as she goes without much support. You could say that Charlie is the detective character updated for the current generation living in the casual-employment/gig-work/side-hustle economy. Outside of the likeable lead, most of the other elements of the series are pretty solid, if occasionally requiring some commitment from the viewer . The hour-plus run times that streaming makes possible enabled lots of setup for ongoing character arcs in episode one but also was used to lay out multiple additional characters in the new setting Charlie arrives at while on the road in episode two. Hopefully the episode scripts get a bit tighter as the series progresses. The first two episodes use a version of the crime solving narrative format used in Columbo and Law and Order: Criminal Intent. That is, we are shown up front the events of the crime, and the question to be resolved is not whodunnit but how close will they get to getting away with it before the investigator gets involved and then catches them out. The specific non-linear narrative structure used here - in which the action starts with the crime then the timeline flashes back to before Charlie crosses paths with those events - could quickly get old if repeated consistently. (Unless, perhaps, the writers play around with some variations of it.) The show’s production has a retro feel, utilising seventies/eighties era colours and fonts for the credits, and a tendency to lean on in-camera or otherwise low-tech methods to add expressive visuals. For example, a youth’s alienation is flagged by shooting his point of view watching a flirting couple through the smudged pane of a frosted refrigerator door in a store. The success of the show will depend on how well it combines an ongoing arc for Charlie with standalone crime of the week stories. There is apparently a packed cast of name actors slated for future episodes. John Ratzenberger in episode two provides a solid but non-showy performance in a supporting role, while the casino boss in ep one gave Adrian Brody a chance to deliver a dense backstory in the enjoyable form of a rhythmically flowing yarn. So, the uses the guest cast are put to will probably vary. The mildly taxing screen time demands of setting up a new scenario in each episode lost them half a star. Otherwise episodes went down easy, combining humour and dramatic tension in clear and enjoyable ways. This is almost certainly a worthwhile series to follow.'), ('9', ""Outstanding show so far. Perfectly cast and great writing. Natasha Lyonne is very entertaining to watch and easily carries the lead role. I'd say it's on or near the same quality as Columbo, and that's saying a lot.""), ('6', 'Reminds me of the old Ellery Queen show where they gave you the clues and Jim Hutton would break the fourth wall and ask, “Have you solved it yet?” In this case they drop a heavy-handed, non sequitur clue you can only miss if not paying attention.

Good actors helped the premier.'), ('5', ""The first two episodes are engaging and fun, with great cinematography. The show becomes increasingly formulaic with less mystery and less believability in each new episode. I'd say it's a 7 for the first 2 episodes, trending towards a 4 later in the season.

We\'d rate it ""give it a try and you may like it.""'), ('7', 'Natasha Lyonne is a really great fit for this role and does a excellent job with it. The show itself is highly addictive similar to SVU or Criminal Minds, its formulaic in the same way but never seems to get old.

The Last of Us,"Jan 15, 2023",2 Seasons,84,5.9,"{('5', 'George Romeo condemned The Walking Dead as a soap opera and The Last of Us is a little too much of that too. But the worst of it is the season finale. It could\'ve been a good ending, possibly great. Ellie might have been presented with the hard choice of sacrificing herself in order to maybe save the human race. I mean, she spent most of the first season risking her life to maybe save the human race, but in the end the people creating the show made the deliberate choice to give us the triumph of selfishness over heroism. They turned Ellie into a victim and made Joel appear like a monster who kills half the people trying to save the human race. Oh, you might say, but Joel was trying to save Ellie. Sure, he probably saw it that way. But the problem is we the audience don\'t really know what\'s happening because we weren\'t shown what happened to Ellie while Joel was unconscious. Was she offered a choice? Was she treated like a lab rat with no rights? The most important plot point in the show and we\'ll never know the answer because the show runners either lacked the nerve to put it on screen or don\'t know the difference between good and evil. And based on what I saw on the screen the story ends with the human race doomed thanks in part to one man\'s evil. There are other problems, too. Like the flashlight batteries still holding a charge 20 years after. Like the ""survivalist"" relying on gasoline and diesel fuel long after either would have degraded into garbage. Like the dam still supplying some people with electricity, because, you know, Jesus descended from the Heavens to ensure that the people with the technical background to keep a hydroelectric station running would still be on the job. Like the zombies. Not because it\'s fungus turning people into zombies. Because I read about fungus and bugs years ago so matching the fungus with people isn\'t that big of a leap. The problem here is that the zombies, on the rare occasions when we see them, look like something out of a Troma release. It doesn\'t matter if you start the film with scientists explaining that fungus zombies are a real possibility if the zombies you put on-screen look like some no-budget 1950s movie monster. I give the series a 5 because it\'s watchable, and, frankly, the show runners deserve some cred for episode three, which is probably the best episode of all.

In the game, Joel's brutality and ruthlessness early on is important because it makes his change throughout the game and progression with his relationship with Ellie more impactfiul, but it is lacking in the show.

These are all a bunch of high school kids making it big in music. Just have them talk normal. Later, the show has to be barrel through its plot. The beautiful cinematography makes way for just so-so shots that serve the overall purpose of the story. The story itself is like a fan-fiction of Fleetwood Mac’s story. Why not make a Fleetwood Mac miniseries? Probably a rights issue. The Daisy Jones character is set up to be insufferable. You may have met this person before. Daisy oozes unearned privilege. The counterpart, Billy Dunn, is supposed to be equally insufferable as the micromanaging band leader. But Billy does what it takes to be a success, and spoiler alert, he mostly does it sober! This kind of asymmetrical love/hate relationship just didn’t work for me. I find the real story of rotating relationships and hurt feelings to be much more interesting. A big criticism of the show is the music. The made up hits just don’t work. This where a show about Fleetwood Mac would thrive, because the real hits are great. The music really becomes an annoyance in the later episodes that feature live shows. My personal pet peeve is all of the smoking in the series.

Frasier (2023),"Oct 12, 2023",1 Season,56,7.2,"{('4', 'Very dated (studio audience with a laugh track). Not too funny. :-( Our view is: ""skip it and watch the old Frazier if you must.""'), ('9', 'What show were these critics watching? It’s literally Frasier but now. The cringe factor seems to be more about protest over it not literally being cast as a direct sequel to season 11 of Frasier. Frankly I’ve watched those 11 seasons to death. I welcome new characters interacting with Frasier, and as much as I miss Martin Crane, not much we can do about that now. I do appreciate them trying to mirror what made the last series so successful. A father and son trying to build a life were they valued being close to each other. Looking good, Frasier, looking forward to the rest of this season and watching all these episodes with my dad too.'), ('9', 'This is Frasier. It\'s a simple family comedy with a laugh track. Critics seem to have written it off, but it\'s not Frasier that changed, it\'s them. The first 10 minutes of the show were unbelievably awkward, and my guess is many critics stopped watching there and started complaining. The internet has really ruined simple, straightforward family comedy in the last five years. People don\'t watch TV anymore to watch it. They watch to complain about it online. This is pretty much Frasier at his best with a surrounding cast that can\'t keep up. And that\'s exactly what the original Frasier was, too. Ross was never as funny as people remember. Neither was Niles. Neither was his dad (although he was close). The premise of the original Frasier was ""This is Kelsey Grammar out-comedying everyone around him with one-liners to their situations."" It\'s the same thing here. Don\'t listen to critics. Watch this show. It\'s worth it just to see Kelsey Grammar be brilliant one more time.'), ('9', ""I thought the first episode was a little sloppy in places, I did find the beginning of the second episode a little sappy. But you know what? I like it. I like it a lot. I had moments where I forgot I was watching the new show and thought I was watching Frasier. It was good, and the new cast is already growing on me. I was sad the Niles and Daphne didn't have any cameo at all, and their son is by far the most under developed character as he's in the least amount of scenes, and they play him as a caricature of his parents since their missing. Still, I'm grateful the show is on the air, gives me something very different to watch these days. Keep in mind one the top shows today is literally about naked people on an island dating lol I miss this more wholesome stuff, plus watched it with my dad, big Frasier fan himself, and he was like it was okay, not bad, just okay and he told me he was just glad to see Kelsey Grammer back doing such a beloved character again, I'll make sure to come back and update this by the end of this first season, here's hoping it just gets better and better from here!""), ('10', 'The original show is my favourite show of all time, and I regard it as one of the best comedies ever written—as do many. So naturally, I was both excited and terrified when I heard it was coming back. Now that it\'s here, and I\'ve had a chance to see the first two episodes, I\'m optimistic. It\'s the same in some ways, different in others, and I get the impression that a tad more thought and care has gone into it than is the norm these days. I can appreciate that, at the very least. Kelsey is great, but the guy played Frasier for twenty years, then spent the next twenty years doing impressions of him for every second fan he met. So yeah, he gets it, he could portray the character whilst in a coma, enough said; there was never a chance he\'d be what let the show down. The rest of the characters are all competently acted even if conservatively conceived. Clearly the intention is to replicate the main archetypes from the original show. As I said, that\'s a very conservative choice, but okay, I can roll with it. I don\'t particularly care if an idea is original, just that it\'s well executed. Over the first two episodes, it\'s impossible to call, but there\'s a decent foundation that can be built upon. The writing is solid, but you can tell it\'s been written in a different day and age. There are some definitive ""old-school"" Frasier moments that conjure up or lean more on nostalgia, as well as more contemporary touches that would feel right at home in any other modern sitcom, but that will stand out to fans of the original. The latter aren\'t bad, just different, more mainstream. Given time, this new melding of tone could end up being the originality that the fundamental ideas lack. Plot-wise I must admit, the stories from both episodes hit me in the feels. This might be where my objectivity fades and I ""fanboy out"" a bit. You have been warned. Freddy relating to his grandfather\'s death on another level in episode one struck a chord. A touch contrived, maybe, but the weight of John Mahoney\'s impeccable portrayal of Martin hung over that whole scene so it was earned nonetheless. We can only imagine how proud Martin was of his firefighting grandson, so it fits. The flag from Martin\'s casket helping to build the bridge between Frasier and Freddy was amazing (my wife was in tears). The father and son in this episode aren\'t as estranged as Martin and Frasier were—nor would it make sense if they were—they just needed a dash of common sense. Martin was always full of that. The second episode was even more impressive than the first, culminating in the most satisfying Darth Vader parody I\'ve ever seen. Frasier contriving the ridiculous story of Freddy\'s lineage to help his son save face in front of his friends was such a Frasier thing to do. How many times have fans seen Frasier relentlessly pursue something out of pure selfishness, only to turn his attention to a person more in need because of his good nature (i.e. ""The 1,000th Show"", ""Death Becomes Him""). He could have rubbed it in more, or taken the moment entirely for himself, but that\'s not the Frasier we know and love. When push comes to shove, Frasier won\'t throw anyone under the bus whatever the cost to him personally. The fact that the writers and show-runners seem to know that, gives me hope… just maybe, they all get it, and will do the show justice. I\'m giving it a 10, not because it was perfect, but because nothing about it detracted from my experience so much that I was anything other than overjoyed about having more Frasier to watch. And that\'s the point, ultimately… it feels like I\'m watching a continuation of something worthwhile, and no reboot of a TV show I\'ve seen before now has ever felt that way. Reboots of this caliber should be the norm and are instead the exception, which is very saddening.'), ('10', ""Dude, what are those critics smoking? It's literally more of Kelsey Grammer playing Frasier, except now it's twenty years later, he got Bibi Blazer's dream famous, walked away, and realized he failed Freddy. Literally, the perfect place to pick up almost 20 years later; keep this in mind, David Hyde Pierce killed any chance of the revival they're complaining about; he decided for everyone else that if John Mahoney wasn't there, there was no point. This killed momentum on a lot of the original cast returning. Honestly, it's better for it; it's forced the writers to get more creative. Such a better show then some of these shills are making it out to be, it's the return of the King of Sitcoms, and their over there acting like it's dead on arrival because it's not Sex in the City; what a bunch of dumb takes.""), ('10', 'I mean it’s a solid start to a series directed by a Cheers co-creator and staring one of the most successful sitcom stars/characters in television history, it’s perfectly fine for what it is, and frankly I’m excited not only for the remaining eight episodes, but for what season 2 will hold in store. I’ve been a diehard Frasier fan for most of my life and frankly the idea for this series is perfect. My mom passed away last month, this was our favorite show together growing up. I got her the Blu-ray’s last year for Christmas, we watched it together before she got diagnosed with lung cancer. I remember her saying her only issue with Frasier is how could he stand at not living closer to Freddy? I genuinely feel like people need to chill out and give season one a chance to breathe. I can already tell it’s gonna be a solid season. As someone else pointed out on here, season one of the Office US did not review well, their trying to find their footing right now, and I want to see them find it to, grateful for a few more seasons with such a loved character like Frasier.'), ('6', ""Better than I was expecting but Rodney is in it.

Next is legacy media, furious about the man behind the character, Kelsey Grammer, a very loud conservative in a far-left industry. They are chomping at the bit to destroy this man. They can't handle him having any more success than he already did. (Literally, all the worst reviews read like a list of the top media giants in the country, as if they are all repeating a scripted response). Look, it's a fresh series with James Burrows in the Director's Chair, the co-creator of Cheers and The Mary Tyler Moore Show, it will continue to get better and better the more room it gets to breath, and I have high confidence it will land well by the end of season 1 with most people, and season 2 like all good sitcoms will be in part based on the feedback of season 1. Remember this, Season 1 of the Office barely managed a higher score then this and still to this day sits at a 66. Remember, many people decrying this reboot know this and just want to make sure it doesn't happen. It's a silly world we live in, now go enjoy some Frasier and decide for yourself! :)""), ('10', ""It is an outstanding start for a new series; what I did not want to see was Frasier season 12; instead, this series takes place 20 years later, and Frasier is now in a very different stage of his life. Some things never change, but in otherways, his focus is different., I also appreciate as someone who rebelled hard against one of my parents as well, Freddy feels like a logical outcome as Frasier, though loving, has always been self-absorbed and obsessed with outward things. I like the new cast, it's fun seeing how Frasier fits into their lives and vice versa, it's a solid beginning to something new, the only character I struggled with was his Nephew feels a little out of place, but I'm open to it, and it seems like a fun actor playing the role. Genuinely excited for the rest of season 1!""), ('10', ""I don't normally leave reviews here, but I saw the absolutely ludicrous critic scores and actually got a little offended by how their talking about Kelsey Grammer and this new show. It is not perfect, I found the first episode to be pretty rough in places, Freddy is going to take some time to grow on me, I can already see this; not the actor's fault, the way they write him, makes him feel cruel when in fact he's really just embarrassed and defensive, is that ever fun to watch? As for the show itself, I can confidently say that by the end of episode 2 I was really charmed by it all. I felt like enough time had passed that Frasier felt like a character coming back to, I love how their is this whole missing chapter in his life getting teased out in discovery dialog, and visually as he buys something most us wouldn't even be able to afford to rent. I won't go on too long here, I just wanted to say, in my humble opinion, this isn't trying to be True Crime Season 4 here; this is a family-friendly sitcom filmed in front of a live audience like a little play put on once a week, it's cute and very fun, and I feel like the critics come off like a bunch of boring jaded monsters who've forgotten how to enjoy simple things. Reminds me honestly of the critic in Pixar's Ratatouille. Lastly, I will just add that Kelsey Grammer has since the first run of Frasier, become pretty loud about his political leanings, you do have to wonder when you see almost all the negative reviews seem to be coming from the most far-left publications.

The main cast is great, people like Winston and Charon look and behave like their movie counterparts and also the new characters fit nicely into this JW world.

Some episodes have less plot than if they stitched together an hour of b-roll. When a character actually does something, it is mind-boggingly dumb and out of character. Also, it seems like Timothy Olyphant filmed all his scenes in a day, and so they had to build an eight-hour miniseries around the ten minutes of footage they had of him'), ('3', 'I was able to complete this soulless follow-up of an excellent, easily re-watchable series. Gone was the classic gallows humor and intelligent banter of Justified, replaced with a generic plot and set of unmemorable characters. The daughter made illogical decisions and didn\'t have anything in common with Raylan or Winona. Instead of complex villains like Boyd, Mags, and Duffy, we get a psychopath in tighty whiteys--whose motivations are money and mayhem. The show was oddly attached to viewing Raylan in a positive light, while trying to apologize for Raylan and the Marshals\' violent behavior which might be seen more negatively in today\'s political climate. I don\'t understand the need for this apology as the original Raylan was portrayed as honorable, but also morally grey and often problematic. Raylan\'s romance with the sketchy judge was incredibly awkward. Raylan\'s one moment with Winona had so much more chemistry, which made it even more obvious this was show was lazily cast and written. In summary, the show felt like they were just cashing in on the name ""Justified"" and the presence of Timothy Olyphant.'), ('3', ""I can't think of many other shows that I have been so excited about ever since they were announced.

Though the last 15 minutes of the finale were actually enjoyable because of some characters from the original series showing up. As for this one, most of the characters were not just not interesting, but annoyingly stupid and not worth watching. Timothy Olyphant still did a great job playing Raylan Givens, but the storyline didn't set him up for success and he seemed a complete misfit in an otherwise terrible show. Many of the actions he took, or didn't take, were not true to his original character. It was a cool touch to see his real life daughter play his daughter in the show, but from a story perspective it was rather irrelevant. And while Boyd Holbrook is a very good actor and it's fun to see him in many roles, the main villain character was not intelligent and so wasn't justice to Holbrook either. I'd say the same for many of the other good actors in the show who unfortunately had to play very weak characters. The witty dialogue, richness of the characters and good storylines that made the original Justified so awesome were all missing in this reboot. Even though the last 15 minutes of the finale hint that there could be another season, I hope that it is developed by the screenwriters as a continuation on the basis of the original Raylan Givens books and the original Justified series. After all if they could write a character like Boyd Crowder so well for 6 seasons, even though he was only supposed to be in the original pilot, then there is no reason they can't expand the original series.

Beyond that, it is a wonderfully crafted story of survival and endurance in the face of death and destruction.

Danny and Ariana decide to attack one person. According to their plan, Danny was supposed to kill this man, but he does not dare to do so. Ariana takes his gun away from him and starts shooting, without aiming very hard, and hits him in the shoulder. Soon the police arrive and Danny is able to escape, but in the evening he is arrested on charges of shooting at Rockefeller Centre. Further plot development will be relayed through the main character\'s flashbacks during interrogations with a psychologist named Raya Goodwin, which reminded me of the narrative system from Mafia: The City of Lost Heaven (also known as Mafia: Definitive Edition). Each episode of this series keeps the viewer in suspense, immersing them in Danny\'s story. The plot of the series is full of plot twists and turns, intriguing the viewer. Near the end of the third series, after learning more about the reasons for their actions, I developed sympathy for the main character. In this series, Tom Holland has demonstrated his outstanding acting skills to date. He has shown that he can successfully handle playing blockbusters like the Marvel films as well as serious and multifaceted roles like in this series. I also hope that this is not Tom\'s last challenging and interesting role, and that we will see him with a well-deserved Oscar in his hands in the future. The costumes in the series are very good, in addition to being appropriate to the time period of the series (late 70\'s), they also better reveal the characters and show their essence. In general, the series ""Crowded Room"" is a noteworthy work. It has an exciting plot, high quality acting and skilful embodiment of characters.

Do I want to flee my daily life by looking into some other everydayman\'s boring and dull existence, where they lustlessly go through their motions, trying to ""sabotage"" others that are just as bored, disappointed as they are in a never-ending slow grind towards their inevitable deaths? The answer for me is a clear ""nope"", and I\'d rather have someone try to make some truly deep characters along the lines of Walther White and Saul Goodman, if you want to go down the ""Drama road"" in all its darkness. If you wanted to explore the whimsical, something I haven\'t seen in a long time, try to find another Hal from Malcolm in the Middle, where Modern Family drifted off into the ""satisfy everyone"" niche too quickly. This one is an unfortunate ""third time\'s not the charm"" for a big B.

But, there was another actor, Olivia Scott Welch (as the daughter), which I just had to check out to see if she was going to be able to produce like I thought she might have the talent to reach... and she is probably going to get there in the first season. In the initial episodes I had the feeling that Olivia Scott Welch was being pushed to hit her first-take mark and produce - just like the other top experienced actors probably were and it was not good enough - in my opinion. Perhaps the producers had budget targets that had to be met until it was clearer if the series was going to be good enough for additional investment. Regardless, in the final scene of episode 7 everything came together... acting, writing, directing, etc... and Olivia Scott Welch produced the best acting I have seen from her.

If you’re set on watching this show, my advice: the minute an episode ends and you find yourself thinking, “Huh, that didn’t make me laugh even once”…just stop watching there. The sketches start off charming and funny enough (if a bit underwhelming) and get progressively less funny as the show goes on.

Overall, the show is funny and keeps you entertained the entire time with only a few episodes being boring. If Season 2 picks from the cast of characters from Twisted Metal 2 and Season 3 from Twisted Metal 3 and so forth, then I can see this show doing very well and lasting quite a while.

Someone who doesn't give a damn and just gives you a crazy nutty show with the right feel to it. Because what we have here is just a silly mess, bad jokes, bad dialogue, bad acting, bad effects and some of the worst humor ever.

His comic sensibilities serve his well as he wise cracks his way thru the villains…with the help of a souped-up car and lots of weapons. Pretty soon, he\'s paired up with a sullen woman (Stephanie Beatriz) and their friendship/rivalry forms the movie\'s core relationship. Her gruff attitude and dry delivery add punch to the duo\'s chemistry. Since this was created by Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick, the duo behind Zombieland and the Deadpool films, you can expect plenty of off-hand violence followed by an off-hand quip.

I wathed the whole season in one day and it was a blast. Yes the graphics is poor at times, and there are a few hollywood cliches. But the chemestry between characters is absolutley flawless, you do belive them to be real people with real feelings. Also amout of refrences and how all of them mixed together is insanely good and satisfying. Actoin scenes are perfect representation of what Twisted Metal truly is.

Through its exploration of a post-apocalyptic world where humans have taken refuge in an underground silo, the show serves as a powerful metaphor for the ways in which we are often conditioned to think and perceive in our own lives. The show raises important questions about the role of knowledge and understanding in our lives, and the importance of sorting through what is truth and what is conditioning. It encourages us to seek out truth and understanding even when it may be uncomfortable or inconvenient, and challenges us to confront the biases that shape our perceptions of the world. The acting in ""Silo"" is superb, with David Oyelowo, Rashida Jones, and Rebecca Ferguson delivering standout performances that capture the nuances of their characters and draw the viewer in. The chemistry between the characters is authentic and engaging, creating a sense of investment in their individual journeys. Overall, ""Silo"" is a must-watch series that delivers a powerful and thought-provoking message about the importance of sorting through truth and understanding in a world that often seems uncertain and chaotic.

I bet they'll introduce a whole lot of new characters next season just to kill them off again.

I am sick and tired of all seeing these race swapped characters. I looked up the books and the graphic novel, it is very clear to me that they race swapped the sheriff, not saying he\'s a bad actor at all though but what\'s the point of just having a male and female both white and married? How is that whole concept fallen out off out current society standards? Why force this interracial stuff? I don\'t understand why they\'re so hung up on blackwashing characters. If it\'s written white, let it stay white. I read that ""Some"" people don\'t like Rebecca Fergusson. I personally think when it comes to this role she\'s playing, she always seems mad, the way she expresses herself during conversations, it comes off as over-acting, I understand certain situations gives you a level of stress or so but hearing F*** a few times within a minute, gets old real fast. Though still I wanna say, I\'ve seen worse actors out there that are A-listers whether it be a series or a movie. Plot wise: I think it is ""OKAY"". Although you can see \'things\' happening from miles away, every plot every \'so-called\' twist is cliché to the max. The throwback to Rebecca Fergusson\'s character\'s childhood is something I skim through, they\'re just unnessacery fillers to fill up time, its annoying.

A few episodes in the middle were a little lackluster but still enjoyable. Looking forward to season 2.

Class of '09,"May 10, 2023",1 Season,63,5.6,"{('10', ""The FX series Class Of '09 smartly layers the past, present, and future in telling this story. Introducing viewers to only two-time frames in the first five minutes made everything that happened in these first two episodes easier to absorb. Kate Mara's performance as Poet is so good that you are (easily) pulled into the third time frame (Present 2023) without it feeling disruptive. You could argue that this story could have been just as good without the time jump. But it feels more attractive told this way and complements the dystopian part of the story set in 2034. The showrunners, writers, and actors did a great job showing the good in 2009 and the ugly in 2034 offering only a glimpse of the bad that's about to happen in 2023 with a great cliffhanger at the end of episode two. This direction made it thrilling and fun to watch.
