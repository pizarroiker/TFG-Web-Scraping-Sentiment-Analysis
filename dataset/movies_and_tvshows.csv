Oppenheimer,2023-07-21,movie,180,89,8.7,"{('0', 'Boring AF. Boring because there is 0 pragmatism in the greatest minds in history. They all act like high schoolers in 40ies elites disguise.'), ('5', '(Mauro Lanari) Nolan plunderes humanistic and scientific disciplines to expose stories from the most bizarre perspectives on time: neuropsychopathology, Bergsonian subjectivism, thermodynamics and this time the Parmenidean aspect of Einstein\'s cosmology. The biopic would also be about the protagonists of QM, but the POV is the one hypothesized by special relativity. This explains the mistreated Fermi and the elite of quantum physics barely glimpsed in favor of the insistent comparison with the theory developed in 1905 by the Ulm physicist: not only Einstein but Thorne who is once again thanked in the credits and Oppenheimer himself with his first publication on black holes. The conception of time according to the Nobel Prize winner coincides with that of the Greek philosopher: ""the distinction between past, present, and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion"" [variant: ""it is only an illusion, however tenacious""]. Becoming is frozen in an eternal compresence of the 3 temporal extensions and the 1st act of the film is structured on the basis of such idea. Admitting its veracity, is it possible to know what it entails on a practical level? Could the principle of ethical responsibility fail? Einstein\'s answer is that everyone would act driven not by a non-existent free will but by their own predetermined nature, so much so that the sentence reported is an excerpt from the letter sent to the Besso family for the death of his friend Michele, while ataraxia and apatheia humorally disappear when it comes to taking care of the paranoid Gödel or drafting the Manifesto with Russell which was followed by the founding of Pugwash. Thus, however, the premise of the 2nd act of the film vanishes, the high school essay on the relationship between science and conscience, a question that Kubrick was able to solve with an ellipsis. Instead Nolan finds himself forced to fall back on linear diegesis by re-embracing Newtonian physics: the end of the daring experimentation and the beginning of the Hollywood blockbuster, the phase for the (successful) attempt to recover the budget starts. Then there is the 3rd act, a courtroom drama where bad and good politics (JFK) clash with Einstein on the right side. Proudhon\'s phrase attributed to Marx? A trifle. The reaction to the Trinity test of the Japanese theologian Kitamori that in 1946 devastated the Trinitarian dogmatics? For more experienced and knowledgeable filmmakers.'), ('10', ""One of the best film in the history, this is the best thing I've ever done Kristofer Nolan""), ('5', 'Over hyped, I expected more from the storyline, it got kinda boring, but a fantastic cast, and nice cinematography.'), ('1', ""It's so boring.

At least Nolan respects it's main characters, unlike Ridley Scott.""), ('3', 'Three hours of star cast with a completely confusing, boring plot. Somehow edited together with constant time jumps. Exciting background music constantly announces a finale that never comes. For me, this was one of the worst filmed biographies I have seen. After Dunkirk and Tenet, the next completely messed up Nolan film.'), ('10', '""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds."" How do I even begin to describe this movie. Why I missed it in the theaters is a mystery to me as well but man, Christopher Nolan is the single most greatest director of all time and I\'m not going to take that back. Going into this I was scared I would get bored but man from the first minute I was hooked all the way to the end. Cillian Murphy deserves an Oscar for his performance as Dr J Robert Oppenheimer. As well as Robert Downey Jr does an absolutely amazing performance as Lewis Strauss. The whole cast is absolutely amazing and the amount of detail put into this is crazy and the large ensemble is too great. Florence Pugh is one of the stars as well along with Emily Blunt. There are so much amazing things about this movie but what I love the most is the character development of Oppenheimer which is mind blowing followed by an incredible script by Nolan himself. The foreshadowing in this thing is crazy as well, the full circle moments are mind blowing as well. And of course the explosion itself doesn\'t disappoint at all, it\'s big, it\'s large and loud. Christopher Nolan is absolutely crazy for this and that\'s what makes me love him even more. The visuals as well are incredible and packed with that beautiful and suspenseful soundtrack by Ludwig Gorranson that I will listen on repeat from now. There are so much more things that I want to say that I can\'t describe in words, end of review, Christopher Nolan is 100% the greatest human being to ever make a film.

Oppenheimer will be Nolan's best work.""), ('5', ""It gets 4 for the acting which is impeccable (if misguided by the direction) but the movies itself is dreadfully boring. They took everything of interest about the making of the atomic bomb, including the devastating impacts on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and focussed instead on political intrigue which I couldn't care less about. Such a missed opportunity to make something genuinely thoughtful and moving about the horrors of nuclear weapons and a crisis of conscience. Also reminiscent of the 1980s in terms of its treatment of female characters, which are either crazy or long suffering. Very reductive.""), ('1', 'Absolutely not an interesting film in which there are too many dialogues and not enough dynamic scenes for such a budget'), ('10', 'A great cinematic achievement. Great acting, great sound, beautiful directing and an award worthy screenplay.'), ('7', 'This was a pretty decent movie, I was a bit disappointed when we spent 3 hours mostly listening to Oppies political views and such rather than physics. The nuclear blast was done incredibly well and you barely stop breathing just like in the movie when it happens, it was well shot and filmed. Some of the actors really fell out of place especially when they were better picks for the casting in regards to the supporting rolls. I do suggest checking it out but not on the movie theaters since the movie is very long and not worth the lengthy, they could have easily cut a decent portion of the time and it would still be good and understandable.'), ('8', 'Loved it. One of Nolan’s best.Managed to make a 3 hour court drama compelling and keep my attention throughout.'), ('8', 'Good enough movie. One of Christopher Nolan’s mid film I will say as a causal fan of Christopher Nolan (my favorite being interstellar) a 3 hour epic of the true story of Dr. Oppenheimer and the atomic bomb. If you’re into history this movie has enough there for you, but it does fall somewhat flat at what it’s trying to do and the structure of the story is clunky and convoluted, the worst part about the movie for me. If your a film buff like myself there’s something there for you but nothing too groundbreaking other than a special effects masterclass. I did find myself somewhat dissatisfied with what I was expecting but if you go in with an open mind and not too many expectations you should enjoy it. It’s on 4k now, check it out. 7.8/10'), ('3', ""Overrated movie, don't understand the high score on IMDB. Not only was the editing horribly done and confusing, the message of the movie was highly politically biased and is basically propaganda. The movie was way too long and could have been 2 hours. And ofcourse it wouldn't be a Hollywood film if there were no misplaced sex scenes involved. The dropping of the bomb on Japan on none civilian targets was basically genocide and a war crime, but the movie didn't touch upon this subject. Also the movie fail to mention that Admiral Chester Nimitz who was in command of the pacific fleet campaign against Japan, wrote a petition to Harry S Truman personally not to use the bomb as the Japanese were about to surrender anyways. However Japan wanted to surrender to Russia under conditions. USA wanted Japan to surrender to USA unconditionally. The dropping of the bomb was therefore politically motivated and was not necessary. This is a failed opportunity of Nolan to clarify history and make this topic relevant that USA should never have built this bomb and use it and basically committed war crimes while doing so, but instead make it anti communist movie instead. The communist threat that never existed. Vietnam became a moderate country, and China is more capitalist than any western nations. The Soviet Russians became democratic and that worked out of them alot, NOT. Russia under a democracy became more military aggressive than during the Soviets communist era. Since democracies have conducted more wars the past few decades than communism, this checks out.""), ('9', '2023 has been mostly very weak for good movies, thankfully this one was one of the better movies.'), ('10', ""Fantastic movie.

Barbie,2023-07-21,movie,114,80,5.2,"{('0', 'This movie provides a very negative and distorted view of the male mindset and portrays this to women as the world we live in. Equality and empowerment is NOT a zero-sum game; by treating it so this movie basks in the same type of hypocritical stereotyping it feigns to fight against, thus the makers of this movie are no better than the chauvinists they take aim at all movie long. Heavy on the preaching, inaccurate on the portrayal of men, and light on story. Awful and hateful movie.'), ('1', ""Toxic femininity versus toxic masculinity. Who lost? Viewer. In short, I'm furious. If it’s detailed, I’ll tell you now, trying to avoid spoilers. Unfortunately, I can’t tell you the plot. So let's move straight to the film's shortcomings, of which I found exactly seven.First. Throughout the film, director Greta Gerwig asks questions and raises issues. She says that the real world is one of men in power and women only playing a secondary role. In Barbieland it's the other way around. However, the plot “turn of the arrow” teaches neither one nor the other anything! The picture shows how terrible it is to live under patriarchy, but demonstrates that matriarchy is the same horror, but in reverse. According to Gerwig, a world where everyone is happy is impossible.Second. At the beginning we see that Barbie is a whole universe where there are separate dolls for each race and profession. But then from the lips of one heroine we hear that in fact, Barbie introduces impossible ideals into the minds of children. As a solution, we are offered a “regular Barbie” without a profession, so that she can decide for herself what to become - but why then are all the other dolls needed, since they are so bad? Does this mean the world doesn't need a Wheelchair Barbie or an Astronaut Barbie?Third. Nobody needs Ken. At the beginning, Gosling's character is tormented by unrequited love for Barbie. He tries to get away from the lack of attention through denial and creepy attempts to introduce patriarchy into Barbieland. But in fact, he just wants to live peacefully with Barbie and receive her attention. Instead, the Kens are taken away from their power and driven back under the bunk, not allowed to play any role in the life of Barbie society. I honestly feel sorry for Ken-Gosling.Fourth. During the course of the film, we are shown that Barbies are happy to be second! They are ready to wear short skirts and carry Kenam beer. Their opinion is changed only by a lecture about how bad it is to be under the heel of men. Why was it necessary to show that Barbie herself is cool to be at her beck and call? And why deprive them of such luxury if it’s normal for them? Gerwig, how do we understand this?Fifth. As the film progresses, nothing in the world changes. Barbie has no influence on real women, Mattel management is made up of men who act like clowns. By the way, there is only one adequate man in the film, and no, it’s not Ken. Then why was all this?Sixth. The film suddenly shows that 1) being pregnant is terrible and 2) being a man who does not live up to masculine ideals is terrible. The first is shown through a pregnant doll, from which everyone stays away for some reason throughout the film. The second is through Michael Cera's character, who doesn't like the Kens' ideas or the Barbie ideas. He just lives on his own and wants to get into the real world, because there is no place for him in Barbieland. Question: WHY does the film show such things?And seventh. When given new opportunities, what is the first thing Barbie does? No, he doesn’t go to defend women’s rights, he doesn’t look for his destiny, but he goes to the gynecologist! The epic of feminism does not give women new rights; instead, the doll acquires new biological characteristics. That's all the film wanted to tell us.I hope at least some of you enjoyed reading this.

Dead Reckoning comes strikingly close, with clear and concise dialogue, Hollywood’s greatest acting talents, and exceptional cinematography from Fraser Taggart.

Like many other Scorsese films, Killers of the Flower Moon explores how evil emerges in a family community and takes control of men\'s actions. Different from other Scorsese films however, the pace doesn\'t accelerate as the film progresses. If anything, it seems to slow down: months and even years seem to go by in the first thirty minutes of the film, while a few days capture the last hour. It seems like historic Scorsese films like The Age of Innocence, Gangs of New York, Silence and this film share the characteristic of a steady, calmer pace, as if the distance of time allowed for a more balanced approach to the material. Running at three and a half hours without the entertaining excesses of Goodfellas or the Wolf of Wall Street, it is not surprising that the film has delivered mixed results at the box office. And yet it\'s as relevant, engaging and disturbing as any other Scorsese film. The film doesn\'t hide its societal point of view, and addresses head on the topic of repression of Native Americans by white populations in American history in the most unequivocal of ways. But running as an undercurrent throughout the film lies another of today\'s hot topics, which is the right of representation (understood as the right to represent something in art, or in this case on the screen). Who is Martin Scorsese to make a film about the abuses to Native Americans by white men? Is it okay that he made the film with the main characters and actors being two white men? Scorsese states in a pre-roll shown before the start of the film that its story was of particular ""personal relevance"" to him. In what way? In making Killers of the Flower Moon, Scorsese states that repression of any person or population is never someone else\'s problem. It\'s ours, and should feel personal to all of us. Representing it on screen is not stealing someone else\'s rights, but on the contrary opening ourselves to the pain of others. That possibility of understanding a different human group, for a filmmaker who made his fame and fortune focusing narrowly on his native New York, is the ultimate theme of the film. Killers of the Flower is masterfully directed by Martin Scorsese and brilliantly acted by Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro and Lily Gladstone. One can only be in awe at how every shot, every camera movement has a purpose, contributes to the story and reminds you of how great an art filmmaking can be.

Scorcese’s choice to focus the story on the “tortured soul” of a dimwitted man and his manipulative genocidal uncle is a destructive waste of time and possibilities. I wonder - what could have this film been with one Indigenous person involved in a leading creative role? There is something much more profound rumbling beneath this Hollywood interpretation of history. Lily Gladstone and every Indigenous actor in this film are stones washing ashore in a storm. They shine, and make the most when given sips of air to breath, offering respite from torture with grace, humility, edge, and spirit. Gladstone’s undoubtedly complex, yet unrealized character Molly is still relegated to a filmmaker afterthought. The Osage people are treated as dogs, poisoned, shot, and do basically nothing to look into how their people are dying. How is this entertainment or helpful to ending the cycle of colonization and stigmatization of Indigenous people as victims? I understand the Osage people hope it is helpful to their people and gets the story out, but, I just don't know. You can tell there is something off when filmmakers feel the need to open their film with a personal disclaimer about how much they wanted to make a movie, and then close it with themselves.

It pains me to even acknowledge that this is the last film in this series. Say it isn’t so, James Gunn! He wrote and directed the film. At the beginning of the film, we see the lights turn off in Quill’s bedroom, illustrating that James Gunn is putting this trilogy to bed. But surely, Marvel won’t really retire this hugely successful part of the MCU, right??? Here’s how the studio describes this final installment: In Marvel Studios “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3” our beloved band of misfits are looking a bit different these days. Peter Quill, still reeling from the loss of Gamora, must rally his team around him to defend the universe along with protecting one of their own. A mission that, if not completed successfully, could quite possibly lead to the end of the Guardians as we know them. THINGS I LIKED: The fantastic cast includes our fan favorites: Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, Karen Gillan, Pom Kementieff, Vin Diesel, Bradley Cooper, Sean Gunn, Chukwudi Iwuji, Will Poulter, Sylvester Stallone, Elizabeth Debicki, and more! The beginning of the movie starts on a sad, serious note, something I wasn’t expecting. Lots of creative set pieces. Gunn does a great job blending tense action scenes with humor and heart. We get to find out Rocket Raccoon’s origin story. Awwww… It is said that many of the songs in the film are diegetic, which means the characters can hear the music. The song that opens and closes the trilogy is “Come and Get Your Love” by Redbone. Sweet. Keep watching during the rolling credits at the end of the movie for another cute scene that references Kevin Bacon. As always, the soundtrack is terrific. The rest of the music by John Murphy was excellent. The story is extremely emotional. You WILL cry. We get a few short cameo performances from a few past characters. Yay! No spoilers! I always love the slow-motion action sequences. So entertaining. THINGS I DIDN’T LIKE: The movie definitely assumes that you already know and love the characters, and understand how the Guardians’ universe works. If you haven’t seen any of the Guardians movies, you should absolutely not start with this one. Start from the beginning. Too many of the costumes and sets look like costumes and sets: more design than magic. In fact, this movie sets a new record for the most prosthetics (23,000) used on over 1000 actors. I wish the voice of Cosmo, the Spacedog, were different. It sounds too much like Mantis’ character. The female voice by Maria Bakalova was used to pay tribute to Laika, the Russian dog who was one of the first animals in space. There are way too many characters to keep track of in this final installment. So much yelling. The movie is messy with tonal changes. There are a lot of flashbacks that might confuse the timeline for some viewers. Ultimately, I wanted more. Because I’m such a fan of the franchise, I really wanted to be blown away but wasn’t. Were you? I need to see it again.

The Battle of Austerlitz showed his brilliant generalship and the battles of Borodino and Moscow were filmed with an economy of images that convey what Tolstoy wrote in 'War and Peace'.

I went to see it with an open mind regarding historical inaccuracy and was not expecting perfection in that regard. All that being said, Mon Dieu where do I start? This was genuinely one of the worst films I have ever seen. I have no idea what this film is trying to be. I can’t tell if it is meant to be a biographical piece, a love story, a war film or a character study but what I do know is it fails spectacularly in being any of them. Trying to cover the life span and impact of one of history’s most famous figures in 2 ½ hrs is absurd (I doubt the extra two hours for the TV showing will make much difference either given the approach taken to the film) and the result is that the film rushes by without a coherent narrative or with the time to allow for any depth or meaning to any scene or character. Further, I can never understand the fascination in ignoring any genuine exploration of such a complex figure by playing up to the ignorant caricatures of anti-French commentators throughout the ages. Love him or hate him, Napoleon is a giant of human history whose genius lay way beyond military strategy and tactics, his impact on the life of France in terms of legislation, banking, education and so on laid the foundation for policies and institutions which shaped modern France (and some would argue some of modern Europe). All of that is boiled down here to an angry little maniac who was a pathetic cuckold to his wife – and who’s only merit was that he was quite good at battles. The agenda was clear from the start and, in case anyone was stupid enough to not get the message during the film, rammed home by ending with a list of casualties during the Napoleonic Wars. Pathetic stuff. This film is to Napoleon what Little Big Man is to Custer. Pheonix is a great actor, and I would give him the benefit of the doubt in suggesting that he played Napoleon as directed. What you get here though is simply an odd hybrid of Commodus and the Joker. In terms of other characters, the pace of the film prevented any meaningful character development but particular mention must go to the Duke of Wellington who is almost literally a cartoon version in this film and who was subsequently, although unintentionally I assume, hilarious to watch. I said I went into the film with an open mind re historical inaccuracy, but nothing could have prepared me for some of the liberties taken here. I won’t go over them all, as it depresses me to recall, but Napoleon leading the cavalry charges in the front line at Borodino and Waterloo are a highlight as is Breakfast with Wellington at the end of the film. This was one of the only films I have ever contemplated walking out of before the end, but I was kept in my seat by interest in how the Battles of Austerlitz and Waterloo would be portrayed. A saving grace of many pretty poor films in the past has been excellent battle scenes and the earlier action at Toulon was one of the better things in the film (except for Napoleon having a panic attack/orgasm when in action – still no idea wtf that was all about). Sadly, these two battles are depressingly handled in every respect and look like really lazily and cheaply produced minor skirmishes which make virtually zero attempt to reflect actual events. For Austerlitz it looked more like they filmed a riot at a Christmas Market to be honest. This is a film that didn’t know what it wanted to be and was way too ambitious to attempt. Unfortunately, this shows throughout with no emotion, no connection, no character development, no discernible story, no excitement, weak dialogue and woeful action. It was a genuine mess. Any positives? The cinematography was good as were the costumes. Also, the film is pretty funny at times if viewed through a certain lens. I think that if the film had been called “Carry on Napoleon” then it would make more sense to the audience.'), ('7', 'Napoleon feels like it wants to be a historical epic and a political satire simultaneously, but in doing so, fails to deliver a structurally sound narrative surrounding Napoleon’s political and romantic life for audiences to sink their teeth into.'), ('10', 'Despite the criticism and factual inaccuracies, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.

Would have loved to watch this as a television series.'), ('8', ""The drama has some low moments, but visually it's the more interesting film in the saga""), ('9', 'Honestly, a great movie. Michael B. Jordan does a great job in his directorial debut. I like how the plot is based on Adonis Creed and not off of his father or Rocky. The end fight is amazing.'), ('6', 'ok thats it for the creed franchise - its done well so leave it at that yeah'), ('7', ""I love the Rocky franchise. It has its lows and its over-the-top entries but for the most part, this series has been mostly hits than misses. Creed was a spinoff and I never expected to enjoy it so immensely. I loved Creed 1 and Creed 2 which is why I was hoping for a hat trick with Creed 3. There was some worry as this is the first entry without Rocky. it was also Michael B. Jordan's directorial debut with him starring as Creed and directing. So does it succeed or is this a miss? Firstly, Michael did a great job in his directorial debut. He pushes the Creed movies out of Rocky's shadow and gives it more grit. The fights feel more visceral and flashy with some clear anime-inspired influence. He uses a lot of slow-mo which leads to some nice-looking shots. I also think the boxing intro and montage were also really well shot as well. He also does something interesting in the final fight that involves silence which gave it a new feel. The soundtrack was awesome and the cinematography is great. He also gives darker qualities to the story with the backstory and personal connection with the antagonist Damian (Jonathan Majors). On that note, Jonathan Majors is terrific as the antagonist. I love his performance, with the subtle awkwardness and slightly pained expression in the first half. Then in the second half, we get to see Jonathan give an arrogant, menacing performance when he goes full bad guy. I also enjoyed how sympathetic he is as a character as well. You understand why Adonis would help him. Additionally, Michael continues to give a great performance as Adonis Creed with the amount of emotional moments in this film. There is great chemistry between Michael and Jonathan which made the friendship between their characters feel believable. Tessa returns as Bianca and she is good in her small role in this film as well. However, I do have some issues with this film. The first half focuses on building up the characters and eventual conflict which is fine. The second half is incredibly rushed though with clearly many cuts made towards it. We don't get a great sense of how much time passed so it is baffling to suddenly see Damian successful so quickly. It would've helped to have seen Damian in more fights. We could have seen him growing more and more successful while also seeing how much of a threat he is. Unfortunately, this movie doesn't have a lot of boxing fights and enough build-up in the second half. It is also weird how quickly Damian's personality changes. Another issue is the lack of inner conflict for Adonis. We see him feeling guilty about what happened to Damian but that's mostly it. For example, we don't see his doubt about retiring or concern about his daughter and wife. On that note, there is a daughter subplot introduced in this film that went nowhere. Felt very pointless. Overall, Creed III is another good entry in this franchise. It's an impressive directorial debut from Michael and I look forward to future work from him, Creed or otherwise. Even without Rocky, this franchise seems to be doing well standing on its own feet. I'm not sure what direction Creed 4 can go in but if it is of a similar quality to previous entries, then I will 100% be there to watch!""), ('5', 'Not a bad movie and not a good one.

However, the novelty of the series has run its course and believe it or not, not having Stallone involved actually hurt this installment.'), ('7', ""I think Creed III was very entertaining but not as good as the last two. The stakes don't feel as high in this one and I thought that the dramatic punch that the finale of both the first and second had was missing here.

I feel like this movie would have benefitted from being a bit longer and develop why Donnie fighting Damian was actually worth it. Jonathan Majors is electric in this film and the film blows by really quickly.""), ('8', ""As a Rocky fan who didn't really love Creed II, I thought Creed III was the true sequel to the first Creed (which I hold in high regard and the best Rocky film besides the first). Similar narrative themes can be found from writer Ryan Coogler's other films like Creed, Black Panther, and Fruitvale Station but Creed III's unique identity definitely comes from new-director Michael B. Jordan, who infuses his own sensibilities and tastes into every scene. Especially the fight sequences. The film's core story felt similar to Rocky V but done in the right way; solid performances, great cinematography, well-paced editing, and clear directionality to the narrative. The film charts into more familiar and predictable territory near the half way marker where character, unfortunately, take a turn into cliche stereotypes and lose a bit of humanity. Emotional clarity is lost during training montages and what's at stake is a little muddled. Fortunately, it does end off on a high note with a satisfactory conclusion. I truly did feel like the absence of Sylvester Stalone's Rocky was not only missed, but could've been narratively powerful, sending the film soaring.

Jordan is once again excellent as Adonis Creed, but this time he is not only boxing, but also searching for his place in the world. The masterfully choreographed fight scenes and emotional depth of the characters make each fight meaningful, and the film brings new life to martial arts cinema.

In addition, the film successfully combines new dynamic characters with familiar historical plots, allowing the viewer to plunge into an exciting journey of training, fame and betrayal.

The fights in this third installment are spectacular!'), ('8', 'IN A NUTSHELL: He’s back! Adonis has been thriving in both his career and family life, but when a childhood friend and former boxing prodigy resurfaces, the face-off is more than just a fight. Congratulations to Michael B. Jordan for directing this movie, as well as starring in it! He was the Executive Producer of the 2018 Creed II, and now he’s ready for the big show. He loves anime, so you actually see some influences from Dragon Ball Z and Naruto in the film. The writing team consists of Keenan Coogler, Zach Baylin, and Ryan Coogler. THINGS I LIKED: The terrific cat includes Michael B. Jordan, Tessa Thompson, Jonathan Majors, Wood Harris, Phylicia Rashad, and Thaddeus J. Mixson as the young Adonis Creed. I’ve never seen a bad performance by Michael B. Jordan. As expected, he’s great in this movie. Jonathan Majors looks amazing and does a fantastic job. You should also check out his recent performance in Devotion. Little Mila Davis-Kent is totally adorable as Creed’s daughter. She’s deaf in real life. Amazing slow-motion boxing shots. Wow. For all of you fellow nerds out there, you’ll be interested to know that this 3rd movie in the Creed series is being released on the 3rd day of the 3rd month in the 3rd year of the 3rd decade of the third millennium of the Common Era. It’s fun to hang out in Adonis Creed’s gorgeous house. I love that the movie features some of the pageantry in boxing when both boxers parade into the arena with their music and entourage before the big fight. That’s always my favorite part of boxing matches. One of my sons was a boxer for a short time. My husband thinks boxing is the coolest sport ever. I love training montages, except I felt like such a slug watching it while sitting on my butt and eating while watching. I definitely need to work out harder. Ha ha Hard-hitting soundtrack! I’m always amazed at how they film boxing scenes to make them look so real. I thought the scenes that just showed the two of them, alone, in a ring were especially effective and offered the perspective of how personal the fight was for the two men. Many of the famous boxing announcers and TV personalities offer cameo performances. I always get a kick out of that because it lends credibility to the scenes as if they’re in real-life. THINGS I DIDN’T LIKE: Sylvester Stallone does not appear in this sequel, which is a shame. He crafted the Rocky character and franchise, but was, sadly, left out of this new addition. That seems super disrespectful to ole Sly, as well as a disappointment to many fans. He hasn’t hidden his frustration about being shut down by Ryan Coogler and Irwin Winkler, saying he’ll never watch this movie. What’s really missing in this sequel is the heart and soul that Rocky always gave us. I assume we’re going to see Bianca competing in the ring one of these days, eh? Act 3 feels very rushed compared to the first two acts. For example, we see Dane call out Adonis in a show, and then, suddenly, they’re training and in the ring. There’s no conversation between Adonis and his wife who, surely, would have a strong opinion about his fighting again after so many physical dangers to his battered body. We see her hugging him as he enters the ring, clearly supporting him in his decision to fight again. It just felt like a huge jump in time and story. Like all of the movies in the Rocky and Creed universe, this film is extremely predictable. TIPS FOR PARENTS: Sign language and Spanish are spoken with subtitles. Lots of fighting action in and outside of the boxing ring. Talk of jail time. A girl gets in trouble at school for punching another student. Some of the music has explicit profanity and offensive language, including the “N” word. Some young teens get in a fight with a gun when cops arrive on the scene.'), ('5', ""We gotta talk about some issues with the movie and yes there are good amount of issues. And this is alright movie .Firstside plot they show Creed daughter getting bully from a cartoon villain. Got a fight with her and than it doesn't get bring up again. So what's the point? For a tie end story . Second side plot Bianca she retired from singing and Dane is is taking to guilt shame her this girl is singing her song . Number three killing her mom was lazy and trying to copy from Rocky 3 . Even Dane character started out good like clubber Lang than it went Abit really really is this happening.""), ('7', 'Possibly has the weakest boxing scenes of any of the Creed or even the Rocky movies. Michael B. Jordan tries to be too stylish with the slow motion and etc. The story and performances are at least good. It’s funny how Jonathan Majors pays the older one of the two former friends. When Michael B. Jordan is 36 and Majors is 33. I was into the main fight until it pretty much turned into a silly dream sequence. That was more about the cgi than the fight. By the time it got back to reality, I barely cared anymore about the fight. There was too much style. That takes you out of the fight. With the last fight weaker than maybe any from a Rocky or Creed movie. The movie is more about the friendship and their history than the fight but still the fight was weak.'), ('7', ""CREED 3 is a good movie and very fun. I am happy to see we can have a boxing movie without Rocky (Let the dude retire, he deserves it by now!). There is really good character development around the main cast, though most of the side characters tended to blend together; no Michael Peña from Ant-Man here, but that is fine, it should be about Creed and his family, after all. They did pretty good with Drago and left me wanting a spin-off and seeing him become champion! I wouldn't be against a Rocky Cinematic Universe. I also really enjoyed the music quite a bit, even though I don’t really listen to rap. All the orchestral and rap music fit the scenes and vibe of the film. And the boxing scenes may be some of the best looking yet. Like in every Rocky and Creed film, they try new cinematography ideas for the boxing scenes; they were pretty interesting. There were a few scenes I thought were a bit off, but nothing egregious. I did like the antagonist (though I wish they did a better job explaining his specific crime and length of time in prison) as it is one that feels multidimensional and has motivations that are understandable. If you are a fan of the Creed films, this is the third good one in a row and suggest it to any fans of the series. The movie is not perfect as the writing can be rough around the edges, but I enjoyed most of the film and it left me wanting more.""), ('7', ""This was yet another excellent chapter in the Rocky/Creed series, however it's also one of the most aesthetically unique. As this is Michael B. Jordan's first film as a director, I think he is still figuring things out and doesn't quite get the look he was trying for. Also, the movie suffers a little bit to transition between acts; it always feels a little abrupt. Having said that, the rest of the film is effective. The main plus is the antagonist; Jonathan Majors portrays one of the rocky/creed series' most nuanced and engaging antagonists. Outside of him, the battle sequences are superb, the character development is outstanding, and the training montages are strong. Where Michael B.

There are glimpses of thematic and emotional conflict here and there, but it isn't a concern of the film. It losses the emotion but the problem is that it also loses the fun. It's a very atonal film in terms of direction, which doesn't know if it wants to be a comedy or a drama. And the action scenes, which is all the film has, end up falling flat because there's barely any emotional substance to hold it. Besides the plot starts almost one hour in and the film ends with the plot starting to develop. Most characters just feel extremely supporting character, with almost no presence in the film.

Sweet! Fans are thrilled, rewarding the movie with $221 million at the worldwide opening. It was directed by Joaquim Dos Santos, Kemp Powers, and Justin K. Thompson, a truly magical team. Writing credits go to Phil Lord, Chris Miller, and David Callaham. The story is about Miles Morales who catapults across the Multiverse, where he encounters a team of Spider-People charged with protecting its very existence. When the heroes clash on how to handle a new threat, Miles must redefine what it means to be a hero. THINGS I LIKED: The animation is colorful, energetic, and impressively expressive. It combines classic comic book design with modern-day CGI for a thrilling effect. Each frame looks like it came straight out of a moving comic book. Fans are completely nerding out! The cast of voice talents includes Shameik Moore, Hailee Steinfeld, Oscar Isaac, Jake Johnson, Issa Rae, Daniel Kaluuya, Jason Schwartzman, Brian Tyree Henry, J. K. Simmons, Luna Lauren Velez, Greta Lee, Rachel Dratch, Jorma Taccone, Karan Soni, and Shea Whigham. The script is extremely inventive, funny, and heartwarming all at the same time. We get some creative villains that come from various multiverses. Lots and lots of action! The movie takes place across 6 dimensions with 240 characters in it and over 1,000 animators working on it! It’s the largest crew of any animated movie ever made! So many Easter eggs. They include references to six decades of movies, video games, cartoons, and comics. Wow. This is one of those movies that you HAVE to watch more than once in order to catch everything. Scratch that…two or three times! The frames fly so fast and furiously that you simply can’t see it all. I’ve never read comic books, but I hear the movie stays true to the source material. I got a kick out of the Spot villain, the Lego spider verse, and the Indian Spider-Man. haha I’ve always loved animated movies that include live-action characters. The cliffhanger will leave you counting the days until the next installment. Surprising twists caught me off guard. Sweet. There is plenty of humor, both spoken and visual. I’ve just seen a Nicolas Cage cameo in two different movies in two days! His appearance always gets a laugh from the audience. The other is in the new movie that just came out: The Flash. It’s another fun adventure into the metaverse! You can definitely enjoy this movie without having seen the first Spider-verse one; however, you’ll understand and appreciate it even more if you have. If you love Hailee Steinfeld’s character of Gwen Stacey, you’ll be excited to know that a female-focused spin-off is currently in development. THINGS I DIDN’T LIKE: Some viewers and fans will be annoyed that the movie doesn’t actually end at the end and they’ll have to wait an entire year to see the rest of the story. Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-verse is scheduled to be released on March 29, 2024. Some of the action scenes are chaotic and happen so fast that you don’t have time to really savor the moment.

Overall, the film felt rushed, and the decisions felt forced. Not much left for discussion which was a strong point of the book.

Asteroid City,2023-06-16,movie,105,75,6.7,"{('8', ""The very affectionate work of cinema!! The delightfully artistic production design and appealingly pastel cinematograghy as usual from Wes Anderson's film. However, I must honestly say that this might be an beautifully odd and very different film I could ever expected from his post-2010 films. First thing that comes to my mind is that his dark-comedic style and plot-driven actually leave some flaws on the smoothness of emotional relationship for each main characters. But, I somehow find its nice touch from seeing Wes digs deeper into human's loneliness by never leaving its fast pacing and his uniquely dark-comedic style, flawlessly and masterfully. The satire for political events and human connections are also never missed a beat. The unusual narrative can sometimes confuse audiences on their first-half watching, but even so, at some point, once the film reveals its self-concept, I'm pretty sure the audiences will somehow try connecting those dots that film had left for us all along, and certainly find a beauty of the hidden message.""), ('7', 'I connected with the sense of isolation and loneliness. Felt the same issue with French Dispatch where the structure works against it at times...'), ('9', 'IN A NUTSHELL: If you’re a Wes Anderson fan, you’ll get a kick out of his newest addition. He has such a unique, quirky style that entire YouTube channels have been devoted to him by visual artists who create movie trailers in his style. You have to see them! They’re hilarious and awesome! This movie was directed and written by Wes Anderson, with additional writing help from Roman Coppola. The story is about a father who takes his tech-obsessed children to Asteroid City, a small, rural town to compete in a junior stargazing event. His wife, their mother, recently died which changes his world view forever. The story is presented as a play written by a famous writer. THINGS I LIKED: The cast is absolutely fantastic and knocks it out of the park. It includes quite a few Academy Award winners and nominees: Ed Norton, Adrien Brody, Willem Dafoe, Margot Robbie, Bryan Cranston, Tilda Swinton, Tom Hanks, Scarlett Johansson, Jason Schwartzman, Live Schreiber, Matt Dillon, Jeffrey Wright, and so many more! I loved Ed Norton’s fun accent. There’s even an awesome Jeff Goldblum cameo, but don’t blink or you’ll miss it. I love how the camera frames things. Each frame could be a piece of art. Just soak everything in. It’s all so clever and intentional. This is NOT one of those movies that you can have playing in the background while you do something else in the room; you HAVE to watch the screen. The introduction to the characters at the beginning was amusing. Pay attention to their descriptions. The director wanted to film out in the middle of nowhere that was flat. He looked everywhere and finally found a spot in southern Spain. I lived in Spain for 2 years and loved it! Bryan Cranston compared making this movie to an actor’s dream camp. He loved having nightly banquets with all of the other actors. Bill Murray was going to be in the movie but he got Covid-19 right before filming, so Steve Carell stepped in to fill his role. Other than West Anderson’s first movie, Bottle Rocket in 1996, this is the first movie not to feature Bill Murray. The color palette changes from black and white to fully saturated color with a retro look. The dialogue, like all Wes Anderson is witty and delivered dry. I actually like it when actors break the fourth wall. In this movie, they tell the audience, “You can’t wake up if you don’t fall asleep.” While extremely humorous, the movie is also heartbreaking. The music and sound effects are absolutely perfect. THINGS I DIDN’T LIKE: The plot is thin, as if Wes Anderson were more interested in design and creating visually stunning scenes, but they’re not really strung together in a story that the audience can sink their teeth into. There are so many characters without a clear protagonist. There’s no villain or challenge that needs to be overcome. Shifting from color to black and white is an interesting director choice, but it felt more like a distraction than was necessary.

Then why did he even put that in his movie? Unnecessary. )'), ('1', 'I dont even know what I just watched. Its like someone completely disconnected from reality and emotions wrote this.

The army of well known actors is impressive and the visual style is very interesting (1 point for that), but ultimately its a completely pointless movie that could have been made by AI, before AI even had emotions added to it and tried to understand them by making this movie.'), ('7', ""Absence is the key word in Anderson's latest film. Absence of answers and absence of inspiration. ''Asteroid City'' reflects in an abstract, conceptual and lyrical way on the lack of meaning of living; on human beings who search for meanings and new awareness; the discovery of something authentic about ourselves and our place in the world, as well as the mysteries of existence. However, Anderson's aesthetic appears in this film to be folded in on itself, uninspired and not very functional on an expressive level. And in the end, emotional strength is also missing. A refined and accurate work, elegant and pleasant from a visual/formal point of view (the usual pastel colours, the frontal shots, the geometric lateral tracking shots, the moving sets, the infinite cast of stars, the anti-naturalistic staging), interesting underneath that of the narrative structure (an imaginary theater show, which is also a television show, which is also the film we are watching); but which unfortunately remains the victim of the overly calculated and somewhat dry weight of its approach. A unique and coherent cinema, that of Wes Anderson, always beautiful to look at and recognisable; but now we would like it to be a little less theoretical and ''repetitive'', and a little more aimed at that poetic novelty/authenticity originally possessed by the career, as well as at the human dimension that finds in the intensity of feelings the more engaging trait.

The Coens, Tarantino, McDonagh, the films adapted from McCarthy\'s novels are more attracting and satisfying thanks to pulp brutalities exhibited and shown.

The awesome cast is packed full with fan favorites: Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez, Jason Statham, Tyrese Gibson, Ludacris, Charlize Theron, John Cena, Brie Larson, Scott Eastwood, Jason Momoa, and SO many more! It takes only a few minutes before the first car chase and action sequences begin. After that, it’s pretty non-stop adrenaline. We get a lot of fun cameos, so no spoilers! Jason Momoa/Aquaman is hilarious and awesome as an over-the-top villain. His changing hairstyles and gold fingernail polish kept me entertained as he shined on the screen and stole every scene he was in. He looked like he was having an absolute blast making this movie. It’s great to see Rita Moreno. She looks fantastic, as always. Helen Mirren! Yes! She’s such a national treasure. Lots of visual and spoken humor. Almost non-stop action with entertaining and sometimes cool fight sequences. We get to travel around the world in the movie. I always love that.

Keep watching during the final rolling credits for another scene with important information for the next Fast installment, and a fun cameo performance. The movie is delightfully self-aware, as well as completely cognizant of what the fans want. For that, audiences have awarded the film a high 86% on Rotten Tomatoes. Unfortunately, film critics are less impressed, scoring the movie a low 54%. What did YOU think? It definitely feels like a summer blockbuster with all the epic scenes and big moments you’d expect and want. Congrats to the stunt team for their excellent work. THINGS I DIDN’T LIKE: The movie ends abruptly without resolving everything. The film felt unfinished even though it was SO long. All of the main characters get their moment in the movie; however, not all of the characters’ situations are resolved. Some characters get completely dropped after their moment and we never see them again. SPOILER: What happened to the traditional Fast and Furious with the family all eating together at a BBQ? The movie ended more like the Avengers Endgame with characters scattered all over the place. There are a lot of flashbacks that might confuse new viewers about the timeline. There are a lot of characters to keep track of. Newbies won’t quite understand how everyone is connected, nor appreciate their backstories.

Michael Jordan wasn’t directly involved with the movie; however, Ben Affleck consulted with him several times to ensure the story was told accurately. Michael Jordan had two special requests: that Viola Davis play his mother and that Howard White be included in the movie. I love it that Ben Affleck included his long-time buddy, Matt Damon, in the movie. They both also serve as producers of the movie. Matt Damon actually wore a fat suit for this role as Sonny Vaccaro, mostly to give him a big belly. Both Ben Affleck and Matt Damon spent quite a bit of time rewriting the original screenplay, but due to some technical rules by the WGA, they weren’t given writing credits on the film. Boo! This is their 20th movie collaboration together! Viola Davis and Julius Tennon, who are actually married in real life, play Michael Jordan’s parents.

Everyone did an excellent job in their roles. The movie credits open with a quick download of all of the trending things that were happening in the 1980s, long before the word “trending” was a thing, by the way. Michael Jordan wore two different numbers on his jerseys during his career: 45 & 23, so this movie, Air, was released on 4/5/23. Sweet! The fun soundtrack really took me back to the 80s. Ben Affleck wanted to use even more epic songs of the day but buying rights would have put him over budget. Everything is about branding these days. This movie illustrates how a successful company took it to another whole level! I’m always fascinated to learn how legends are made and what contributed to a successful company or marketing campaign. Lots of fun banter between characters. It’s the dialogue that drives the story. We get to see photos and images of all the real people involved in the true story at the end of the movie. We also get to see some of Michael Jordan’s magical moments on the court. THINGS I DIDN’T LIKE: It’s kind of odd that Michel Jordan or the character who plays him isn’t even in the script!

The Killer spouts his philosophy on doing his job, but it all seems to unravel minute by minute. As things crumble in successive vignettes, The Killer has to maintain control as best he can. Bloody, bloody, heavily-narrated hijinks ensue.Well, to be generous, The Killer is deliberately paced. Okay, it is very slow. Fincher has made the choice to build tension by very slowly unfurling this story. There is so much narration by the main character that it becomes oppressive. It’s a good way to get us inside the mind of this unreadable, unknowable man, but it is exhausting and borders on boring. It takes a while for the action of this “Action” movie to kick in, but it might be too little, too late when it does. There is one epic fight sequence that would almost be worth the price of admission, but it comes very late in the film. Beyond that, the Killer uses some interesting and chuckle-worthy aliases on his various travels. Fincher has his typical, cool aesthetic that makes the movie look very slick. I think trimming this movie about 30 minutes would have made it a much more engrossing and vital suspense thriller.Side note: Tilda Swinton comes in for one scene and kills it as usual.Ultimately, The Killer is very slow and there’s not enough story to justify the runtime. This movie should have been cut down by 30 minutes. Fincher is a master of suspense and has a cool aesthetic, but overall, this film is too slow and boring except for one intense fight sequence. I’m bummed to give this is only a handful of popcorn because Fincher movies are typically a favorite of mine.'), ('8', 'Well orchestrated and Michael Fassbender very convincing as Killer with a very process-oriented and almost boring job... until things go wrong. He speaks very little (as the character with a dozen different names) and a lot (in the off, to himself as he explains and reasons). Worth the watch!'), ('5', 'to quote my girfriend: “the best part about it was the ending because it meant it was over”.'), ('7', 'In his latest film, ""The killer"", David Fincher takes us into the twisted mind of a solitary nameless hitman, in a work that is essentially a stream of consciousness, completely filtered from the perspective of a killer devoted to the denial of errors, improvisations, and everything that makes us human beings, such as affections, emotions and empathy. Taken from a comic miniseries written by Matz and illustrated by Luc Jacamon and published from 1998 to 2014 - for many viewers this film may seem banal, monotonous and boring in its linear, schematic, cold and repetitive nature, in reality if you watch it with the right approach you will become passionate, as the tense crescendo is not in the events but in the invisible evolution of the character; an infallible professional killer, highly trained, rigid in following his precise rules of conduct, who loves attention to detail and total control, yet unaware of self-deception on many aspects of his personality and reality, but also on his way of (not) relating to society and the people around him. The careful mix of writing and staging, as effective and controlled as the methodical, cold protagonist, manages to involve and conceal a stimulating reflection on the human psyche and contemporary society, suspended between order and disorder. In fact, the plot is only a pretext to let us enter the psyche of the killer (a convincing and credible Fassbender), who appears almost a re-visitation of the protagonists of Jean-Pierre Melville\'s detective/noir films, but with much less charm. The actor with his icy face manages to tell us all about the detachment but at the same time also the vulnerabilities of his character. Thriller (but also revenge movie) tense and with a geometric style, rich in style and visual refinement, both in staging and in form; ""The Killer"" is an elegant genre film which, thanks to its philosophical (the banality of Evil) and existential slant, is much more than it appears, and, although quite conventional, manages to be interesting and entertain with pleasure. In addition to the beautiful incipit, the director offers us at least two other memorable sequences: a fight in the dark in an apartment and a dialogue with the always good Tilda Swinton. The aforementioned direction is worthy of note, but also the photography and editing, as well as the soundtrack by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross (the alternation of silence with music, and of the monologue with the unsaid is admirable in this sense). In conclusion, ""The killer"" is one of the most successful and meaningful works in David Fincher\'s filmography, and it is recommended to watch it. Score (in tenths): 7.25'), ('8', 'Superb cinematography cast and production quality serve to tell the compelling and disturbing journey of a psychologically deranged hitman getting revenge.

The bad writing wasn't helped by the terrible acting. Even the good actors in this movie just feel like they didn't want to be there. The delivery all just feels off and card boardy.

The metacritic score of the movie is a bit low. It could have gotten a score between 60-69.'), ('7', 'IN A NUTSHELL: Has Marvel lost its touch? Unfortunately, I wasn’t super impressed with the first Captain Marvel movie and I wasn’t super excited about this one either. A lot of people have really loved this new addition to the MCU. How about you? This movie is directed and written by Nia DaCosta with the help of Megan McDonnell and Elissa Karasik. Megan McDonnell was a story editor on the WandaVision (2021) TV series. Nia DaCosta is the first Black woman and the fourth woman to direct a Marvel Studios movie. THINGS I LIKED: Brie Larson looks fantastic. It was hard to relate to Captain Marvel in her first movie because she showed no weaknesses. All of the other superheroes have some kind of flaw or quirk that makes them endearing. Finally, in this movie, she reveals doubts about herself, has concerns, and doesn’t have the arrogant look on her face that she did in the first Captain Marvel. I liked her character so much more in this film. The newest Marvel to join the team is played by Iman Vellani. She’s very enthusiastic and offers a lot of comic relief for the movie. Not only is she the first Pakistani superhero, but she’s also the first mutant to be introduced to the MCU. Some of the special effects are pretty cool. Another part of the Marvel team is the lovely Teyonha Parris, who also does a great job. We also can’t forget Samuel L. Jackson who has now been in 10 Marvel movies, plus the post-credits scene in Iron Man in 2008. Cats and kittens! Weird ones though. It was funny when a song from the Broadway musical “Cats” started playing. With all of the focus on female empowerment between villains and heroines, I guess you could say this gives new meaning to catfights. Ha ha Keep watching after the final rolling credits for another fun clip. If you enjoyed the cats in the 2019 Captain Marvel movie, you’ll be happy to know they’re back. Well, the cat characters are back, although the cat “actors” are different. You can see my review of that first Captain Marvel movie on my “Movie Review Mom” YouTube channel. I’ve never read comic books, but it’s interesting to learn that the idea for the Marvels switching places when they use their powers is an homage to the original series in the 1960s when Captain Marvel would switch places with his teen sidekick Rick Jones. There are LOTS of action sequences! The story is very imaginative. It doesn’t always make complete sense but it sure is creative. The soundtrack is fun and energizing, often providing humor to the scenes. The heart of the movie is provided by the Khan family and their love and support for their daughter. Captain Marvel is completely devoted to helping others and always willing to make whatever sacrifices are required without any thought for herself. THINGS I DIDN’T LIKE: The script is simply too busy and messy. It’s destined to be easily forgettable. We barely have time to get to know the new Marvels in Act 1. We’re supposed to root for them but we don’t even know them. The movie tries to inject humor but it doesn’t always land. It’s yet one more female-empowerment movie that emphasizes diversity. As a mom of 4 sons, it really annoys me when all of the men in a movie are useless buffoons and the women are the heroes. The female villain just wasn’t compelling at all. Some of the action sequences are so fast that it’s hard to see exactly what’s going on. TIPS FOR PARENTS: Some profanity Cute cates become pretty scary. Violence with various weapons and hand-to-hand combat Explosions and destruction People in perilous situations Young kids will appreciate the colorful palette and exciting action, but might not be able to fully understand the story.'), ('10', ""Saw the movie tonight.

Spoiler alert: they weren\'t kidding (except for a nicely portrayed old school Paladin). But, being a parent of a teen, he was quite keen to see this movie, and we have strongly bonded over both baseball and old school AD&D, so off to the theater we went (matinee prices). I played AD&D in the 80s, during the height of the ""zomg satanic"" scares. My friends and I were, above all, nerds. Stranger Things portrayed that aspect of us quite well, minus the parallel world and telekinetic teen. It\'s been a joy to play AD&D as DM for my children and friends, although we are strictly a 1e, not 5e world. I\'m sort of pleased to see so many people trying to retrofit to 1e from 5e in light of latest drama. However, having said that, I still recognized that this movie was going to try to cater/nod its way towards 5e players. The inclusion of things like the Dragonborn and bird people(?) races confirmed that for me. To the critiques: Even APART from ""most tabletop adventures at home will be better than what the writers can come up with"" criticism (which I find quite valid), we shouldn\'t forget that Gary Gygax et al created just EPIC adventures in module form. Tomb of Horrors, the Against the Giants series, even The Temple of Elemental Evil are all rousing adventures that are just sort of . . . out there for inspiration. My son pointed out that adventures like that almost might be better for a streaming service, in a serial form. That would also allow for far more character development/arcs. More nitpicky: I guess that while I enjoyed the movie, I also had quite a few problems with the writers not taking a few simple extra steps for either fan service, or just . . . making the movie MORE like D&D. For instance, Capt. Kirk certainly is portrayed to be a Bard. The old Bard started off as a fighter, abandons that class to become a thief, and then after sufficient time becomes a Bard, whereupon the character can employ abilities from the two abandoned classes. Capt. Kirk is shown, early in the movie, to be a fighter (armored, with a sword), later gives that up to become a thief, and then wields a lute, but there\'s no mention as to why that\'s important. IS he even a Bard, or do they just go to efforts to make it look that way, and then ""lol nope?"" Even a throwaway line might have helped, much less him using his OWN lute to cast an illusion at a later point in the movie (I won\'t be specific since it\'s just out). Also, what was with the ""wheel of spells"" thing on the belt of the Magic User? Not a line about how he got it, what it even is, or why he is inept at selecting spells? Is it a random thing, like the Deck of Many Things, or a Wand of Wonder? There is a single mention of the word ""Cleric"" in the movie -- those are typically healers. With a bit more knowledge, the writers could have allowed the Magic User to say, at a CERTAIN point in the movie (""I can\'t help [person]. I\'m not a cleric.""). Something like that, at least. Finally, they went to a hell of a lot of trouble to obtain the helm -- did anyone see what became of it by the end of the movie? Is this a Shazam 2 thing, where in the next movie someone is going to find it in a museum? Despite all these criticisms overall the movie was certainly . . . mid. Worth the matinee price at least.

The story starts with the bard Edgin and female barbarian Holga in a prison. They hope to be pardoned and telling the story how they got into trouble. However this is just the set up as they did not know that there was more behind it. The story fully works. All characters have their flaws, motivations and heroes journey.

Other than this story flaw the acting, cinematography, and overall movie is quite good. Each scene seemed to present itself as depressing rather than as normal or hopeful. So, our view is: ""go ahead and watch the movie but do something to keep from being depressed.""'), ('8', ""In this latest offering from director Alexander Payne ('Election', 'Sideways', 'The Descendants', etc.), set in the 70s, a grumpy and contentious college history professor (Paul Giamatti) finds himself stuck on campus watching over the handful of young men unable to return home for the holidays for various reasons, and finds himself unexpectedly bonding and sympathizing with a particularly troubled young student (Dominic Sessa in an incredible debut). First of all, I didn't have too high of expectations going into this one, because truth be told, I've never really been all that big on Alexander Payne films. They've typically never been my cup of tea, as I find them a little too straightforward, pedestrian, or simply not funny or memorable enough. Most people seem to love his sophomore film 'Election', which I always found incredibly overrated and populated with nothing but unlikable characters. 'The Descendants' was cute and at times emotional, but also mostly forgettable in my eyes. And 'Nebraska' was simply boring and too understated. The only film of his I've ever truly loved is 'Sideways', which was full of wit, humor, and heart. Coincidentally enough, this was the only other time him and Giamatti worked together, that is until this film of course. And after watching this one, I've come to the conclusion that both of these men collaborating together creates pure onscreen magic, because I absolutely adored just about every minute of this funny, heartwarming, and charming little film. And yes, this is largely in part thanks to Giamatti and his brash yet yet compelling and humorous performance, but his chemistry and onscreen charisma and presence, particularly with newcomer Dominic Sessa is also the film's biggest highlight by far. However , Davine Joy Randolph also gives a superb supporting turn here as well. In addition, the screenplay and dialogue is witty and heartwarming in all the right places. Overall, this is a surprising yet very welcome return to form for Payne, and a long overdue reunion between him and Giamatti. I also now consider it the only other truly great film from Payne besides 'Sideways', which to me says a lot. I'm certain it'll charm and delight the pants off of most folks like it did me.""), ('7', ""Paul Giamatti plays a grumpy teacher at a private New England prep school who's assigned to stay over the Christmas break with the students stuck there. Ultimately, he ends up with one particularly smart but troubled lad (newcomer Dominic Sessa, who's actually 22). They butt heads continuously with the only refuge for understanding from the school's head cook (Da'Vine Joy Randolph). As expected, the softening of their strife ends up with quiet connections and underplayed emotions. Since this was directed by Andrew Payne, there's a dry humorous approach that helps make the dramatic elements more palatable. Giamatti creates a curmudgeon with underlying sadness that serves as the film's core. The other performances are genuine and heartfelt. While the outcome is predictable, getting there is a sweet and salty character drama.""), ('6', ""Kinda mediocre in all regards. It's a bit funny, a bit sad, mildly interesting. Doesn't do anything that hasn't been done many times before and much better. Paul Giamatti is great as ever. The other performances are mixed. The young guy in the co-lead role isn't convincing as a student. I was left feeling like I'd wasted my time with this. But it's inoffensive and passes the time well enough.""), ('8', 'Really good movie. I was expecting something a little closer to ""Class"", but this is far more earnest than that. An excellent period piece.'), ('6', 'Heartwarming films for the holidays are something we’re all supposed to love, right? Well, if you’re talking about the works of directors like Frank Capra, George Seaton, Michael Curtiz and Chris Columbus, you’d be correct. But, since it’s been so long since we’ve had releases of that quality, in recent years, viewers hungry for such movies have been glomming on to anything that even remotely approaches such titles, whether or not the accolades are deserved. And that, in my view, sums up my feelings on the much-celebrated new feature from director Alexander Payne. This tale of a curmudgeonly, condescending, middle-aged, fuss-budget prep school teacher (Paul Giamatti) assigned to babysit a group of rambunctious students who are unable to be with their families for the year-end holidays has a premise with considerable potential that, unfortunately, is squandered by a narrative that feels loosely stitched together and ultimately comes across as patently undercooked. Indeed, what could have been a fun-filled romp a la a Christmastime take on movies like “Dead Poets Society” (1989), regrettably, comes up decidedly short. Admittedly, the film has its share of modestly funny and warm, fuzzy moments, but many of the scenes don’t flow smoothly from one to the next, creating a storyline that feels forced without delivering the goods to make a release like this work. While it’s true that the film succeeds (surprisingly) at depicting the mostly one-dimensional characters’ requisite personal evolution over the course of the picture, that almost-accidental accomplishment is seriously overshadowed by a series of plot elements that largely feel thrown together, incorporated without a terribly great amount of thought and an undeniable lack of cohesiveness. And, to be honest, the picture’s most interesting character is the academy’s chief cook (Da’Vine Joy Randolph), whose richly layered persona (and deftly nuanced performance) runs circles around those of its other two principals (Giamatti and Dominic Sessa as one of the stranded students). It’s disappointing that a director as talented as Alexander Payne has churned out a project as half-baked as this one is (particularly one that comes across as self-satisfied with itself as this offering often does) when compared to previous titles like “Nebraska” (2013) and “The Descendants” (2011). And would-be viewers should be wary of many of the inflated claims and awards season buzz being showered on this offering. But, in an age in which moviegoers are looking for pictures that provide the kind of holiday cinema comfort they so desperately crave, it’s understandable that such viewers might be drawn to a film like this. It’s just such a shame that they won’t find what they’re looking for in this one.'), ('9', ""Nobody delivers a better witty bon mot than Paul Giamatti. Yes, the movie is sentimental, but that's OK. It reminds me to be grateful for what I have and sympathetic to those who have not. Great script. Excellent cast.""), ('10', 'Always enjoy a good alexander payne film. His movies always have a certain heartfelt feel to them, and this one is no different. Beautiful story. Great characters. Great acting.'), ('6', 'NOT a comedy like the previews show. It has some funny school-boy lines at the start, but quickly descends into the harsh realities of life and the consequences of dealing with them. Dominic Sessa is a 33 year old actor tying to play the part of a high school junior, which is pretty pathetic and fake, especially if you know what a 16 year old junior in high school really looks like. Not a feel good holiday movie, so beware before you go.'), ('10', 'Pure cinematic nostalgia. I was reminded of a time in life; my version of these events. Payne makes coming-of-age stories about grown ups. As if there were an important basic childhood lesson that was missed, which creates a hole that needs to get smoothed over. Since this movie is set over the holidays, we have our Scrooge character and then we have various archetypes, or values, presented by other characters. Do we have more in common with others that we thought? Are we missing out on friendships right under our nose? Is life about adjusting to certain discomforts or radically rejecting them until we achieve satisfaction? There are some profound moments in the film, and they are all deftly handled with a lot of organic breathing room given to the actors to feel out the scene. The beautiful production design (including the choices of camera, film (?), color) sets the stage for the actors to really step into the shoes of the characters. All the performances are good and memorable down to the smallest part. That’s all I would need to say about the direction. The script is fantastic. I haven’t read it, but it feels brought to life accurately. I can feel the script in the film but not in a stuffy way. It has structure, pathos and great little moments that are brought to life through creative interpretation. It feels like a well considered film, neither too far a drama or a comedy; as Dramedies go I’d say it’s 50/50. Many moments are fun and poignant at the same time. I expect The Holdovers to be even more poignant on second viewing now knowing the characters’ full arcs. What impresses me so much about the characters is that they arrive fully formed, they are fully formed throughout, and it ends with them fully formed. Yes there is character growth, but it’s that character growing, not being re-written into someone they weren’t already to begin with. The actors are given a lot of bandwidth to continually bring out different aspects of their characters so nothing feels out of place later whether it’s an aggression or a kindness. Someone can be harsh in one moment, and nice to someone in the next. That’s what life is like. There’s not a firm line between “hero” and “villain” like in many works of fiction. Everyone is the “hero” of their own journey, but sometimes they took an arrow without realizing it. And not until they stop blindly moving forward (or half blind?) for a holiday break can they realize where damage was done, pull out the arrow, and make the necessary adjustments to turn the next page of their hero’s journey. The Holdovers is a beautifully story, well told, and a reminder that the scope of a film can be epic even in small moments as long as we understand who the characters are and their choices have weight. 9.5/10'), ('8', 'The cast is really impressive here obviously, would be nice for Giamatti to get some award recognitions this cycle.

Are you still thinking all of this Metaverse hype is fun or are you growing tired of it? Just curious. Comment down below! THINGS I LIKED: I attended a press screening with an audience that was ready for a good time. Within 1 minute, the audience was laughing. Nice! There was also destruction and tons of action within minutes. Ezra Miller did a fantastic job playing two characters: The Flash and Barry Allen. He gives us two-in-one characters to root for and shows us two levels of maturity with entertaining nuances. I LOVED Michael Keaton as one of the Batmen in previous movies, so I loved that they brought him back for this! I thought it was really clever how they addressed how there could be so many different Batmen in our world by utilizing the Metaverse. Conveniently, this movie ignores the story in the 1995 Batman Forever, as well as the 1997 Batman and Robin to have the 1992 Batman Returns movie make more sense to fit Michael Keaton’s storyline. Michael Keaton is now, officially, the oldest actor to play a live-action Batman. He’s currently 71 years old. Adam West was actually 88 when he voiced the 2017 animation of Batman vs. Two-Face! Ben Affleck hasn’t been my favorite Batman, but he did a good job in this. I loved the ending of the movie that left us all hanging as to who will be the next Batman in THIS universe! Ha ha Ben Affleck had some issues with the Justice League movie but revealed in a recent interview that he really enjoyed his role in this movie, as short as it was. The audience I watched the movie with absolutely loved the montage of Superman actors, especially Nicolas Cage who was ALMOST a superhero in a Superman movie many years ago in real life. Michael Shannon always does such a great job as a villain. His clear mask on his space uniform was pretty cool. Super amusing sound effects. While this movie isn’t exactly an origin story for The Flash, we get to learn a lot more about him, his past, and his motivations. Sasha Calle is the first Latina to play Supergirl. Congrats, Sasha! Others in the cast include Kiersey Clemons, Ron Livingston, Ian Loh, and Saoirse-Monica Jack. Everyone did a great job. The movie was shot entirely with IMAX cameras by Henry Braham. The only other DC movie to do that was the 2021 movie The Suicide Squad. Great special effects. I always love the Flash’s slow-motion sequences, so I was surprised when the guy I sat next to leaned over and said he thought they lasted too long. I still loved them. I loved the very last scene. What a great cliffhanger. The big bad spaceship looked just like a beetle. Some of the designs for weapons were cool too. THINGS I DIDN’T LIKE: Gotham City is always falling apart. Ha ha If you get vertigo as I do, be warned that there will be a few scenes that make you a little bit dizzy. There mostly at the beginning of the movie. I was worried it was going to be like that the entire time, but it wasn’t. Drats…I’m getting old! I wanted to hear the audience’s reactions throughout the film, but the movie was really loud and drowned out most of the noise from the audience. Surprisingly, there are some fake CGI moments. Some of the action sequences looked like they came straight out of a video game. Some viewers might complain about the unnecessarily long length of the movie. Everyone bleeds from the mouth with fake makeup. Ha ha TIPS FOR PARENTS: A few conversations about intimate relations. A surprisingly high number of crude words. Come on, Hollywood! Some profanity in English and Spanish, including 1 F-bomb Talk of the death of a parent We see people get hurt, sometimes with blood We see a naked guy but no private parts show We see a guy in his underwear Someone throws up…a lot.

Sofia Coppola perfectly contrasts the Elvis film from last year, showing how Priscilla had everything and yet nothing at all. Gorgeous movie from beginning to end'), ('5', ""This film details Priscilla Presley's courtship and marriage to Elvis Presley, starting when she meets him at age 15 living in Germany with her parents. His creepy obsession with her develops into their eventual nuptials, but we know from her book that he treated her like a dress-up doll with very specific guidelines for her presentation. As for Elvis' POV, Jacob Elordi doesn't look or sound much like the real thing and lacks much charisma (there's also none of his music). In the title role, Cailee Spaeny effectively transitions from innocence to miserable to determined. Writer/director Sofia Coppola has obsessed over the details of Priscilla's rise and fall with lovely wardrobe and cool cars. Even thought there's some mean treatment and sad outcomes, there's never much emotional connection, rendering the whole affair (pun intended) sad. It's especially distracting that she chose to shoot the entire picture with a dark overtone that makes it hard to see faces…even the poolside scenes are moody. I guess Coppolla is trying to emphasize the dreary aspects of the relationship, but her focus on the exterior elements ultimately makes Priscilla's story sympathetic but flat.""), ('6', 'all meat no bone.

I think this film appeals to those who are already familiar with the Elvis and Priscilla story. I am not, and consequently was not as entertained.""), ('7', ""The latest film from writer/director Sofia Coppola depicts the story of Priscilla Presley (Cailee Spaeny), her life/upbringing, and her marriage to Elvis (Jacob Elordi) and the quiet turmoil that she suffered while with him throughout the years. For starters, I was quite intrigued and eager to see this one in order to compare it to last year's 'Elvis' biopic with Austin Butler. The key differences here are, for starters, the obvious one, which is that this is very much Priscilla's story and perspective this time around. Elvis is a key player here too of course, but most of his scenes and moments are merely context and afterthoughts. Another big contrast is that last year's 'Elvis' film focused very little on his marriage and family life. Unlike that film, we're given next to no detail about Elvis's own turmoil that he was suffering through with his numerous infidelities, substance abuse, and of course his financial abuse at the hands of Col. Tom Parker. We're quite literally seeing Elvis's downward spiral and at times harsh treatment of Priscilla through her eyes in this film. This proved a unique and much more intimate approach to his and Priscilla's story. In addition, Cailee Spaeny gives a star-making turn as Priscilla. Her quiet subtlety here gives way to many heartbreaking moments throughout. As for the king, Jacob Elordi gives a much more brooding and subdued performance than that of Austin Butler's from last year, and while at first glance it may not feel as fully realized or fleshed out as Butler's, this is okay, because you have to remember that in this film, we're only meant to see snippets of what he was going through since we're viewing his struggles and suffering through Priscilla's eyes. Another big highlight was the makeup and hairstyling. The recreations of Priscilla's outfits and hairdos were unbelievably impressive, and if this were a more high-profile film, I'd definitely vouch for it deserving an Oscar nomination in this category in particular. Narratively, a lot of scenes do feel a little redundant and repetitive at times, and while it does admittedly lack the glitz and glamor of last year's 'Elvis', even feeling a little TOO basic by comparison, it makes up for this through simply serving as a poignant and nuanced character study of two individuals whose turbulent marriage/relationship captivated the world for years. In addition, it really does give you a vivid image of just how young Priscilla was when she met Elvis and was so suddenly thrust into a world of fame, luxury, and unwanted attention at the cost of first love. Overall, a basic premise and setup, but Spaeny and Elordi both turn in memorable and committed performances here, and Coppola, who has such a keen and natural eye for the female adolescent gaze and experience, paints a vivid picture of one of the most troubled and tragic women to ever catch the attention of the public eye.""), ('5', ""It was fine. Slow but thank you, SC, for not making it 3+ hours. Set design, costumes and performances are all great. The script/story? Not so much.

They disappear for three days, scaring the living daylights out of their families but while their return should have been a relief, it turns out the horrors are only beginning. Not only do the girls have no memory of what happened to them but they also appear to be showing the tell-tale signs of possession. Growly voices, check. Creepy eyes, check. Lewd comments and unexplained scars, check and check. This is more than enough to call in the expert and who better to call than someone who’s experienced these horrors before, 50 years ago.

The Exorcist: Believer is so shamelessly playing on nostalgia and pretty much remakes the original only without the atmosphere. The only main difference is instead of one possession you’ve got two. And for the price of one, what a bargain. It initially looked like this was going to be a decent exorcism movie but soon enough it descends into chaos and the third act is a complete mess. If it was scary or entertaining I could get over that but unfortunately horror fans will be neither scared nor entertained. There are a couple of things that happen in this movie that I can’t mention for spoiler reasons, but I felt the disrespect to the original and the characters so I can’t see that going down well, especially with all The Exorcist fans. Most cinemas re-released the original Exorcist for the 50th anniversary so for anyone in the mood for this kind of horror movie you’d be better off with that instead. You’re in safe hands with William Friedkin, I can’t say the same for David Gordon Green, who gave us such films like Halloween 2018, Halloween Kills and Halloween Ends. It’s hard to believe this is considered a financial success, especially seeing the completely empty screen I was in and we’re pretty much guaranteed more Exorcist movies. Don’t everyone cheer at once. Whereas I wouldn’t be remotely excited for another movie in this franchise I would see another movie in The Pope’s Exorcist franchise for one reason. That film, although completely ridiculous was entertaining. This on the other hand, despite a promising start was bland, formulaic and not scary. No exorcism movie has ever come close to the original Exorcist and die-hard fans of that movie will not be impressed by this new one. But then again the bar was very high.

The prince was a zero and really struggled through the movie. The color grading is most notable in the finale where its basically impossible to see anything.'), ('9', 'IN A NUTSHELL: Disney has received a lot of terrible reviews of their previous live-action remakes in recent years; however, this one is actually their highest-rated one! Despite audiences mostly loving it, there has been a lot of criticism about various elements in the remake from Hans Christian Anderson purists to the drag community, finding fault with casting and makeup and everything else about it. Disney doesn’t seem to care, as they already have two more live-action remakes scheduled to hit the Big Screen in the near future. This version of the popular Disney musical was directed by Rob Marshall. Writing credits go to David Magee. Just like the original animation, the story is about a young mermaid who makes a deal with the sea witch to trade her beautiful voice for human legs so she can discover the world above water and impress a prince. With all of its controversy, what did YOU think of the movie? On a personal note, I watched the original animated movie with my children when they were very young. I have a melancholy attachment to it, so my expectations were extremely high. I still favor the original, but this one is still a nice addition to the Disney collection. THINGS I LIKED: This remake features the lovely Halle Bailey as Ariel. She has a beautiful voice and truly captures the look of wonder as she discovers the world of humans. When it was revealed that she got the leading part in the movie, the hashtag #NotMyAriel went viral. The controversy wasn’t necessarily because she’s African American but because a Black Ariel wasn’t true to the Danish origin of the story by Hans Christian Andersen. If you’ve seen the movie, do you agree or disagree with that sentiment? I LOVE that this film includes a cute cameo with Jodi Benson, who voices the original Ariel in the animation. In this movie, the actress/singer is seen as the person who gives the new Ariel a fork (“dinglehopper”). Jonah Hauer-King compliments Ariel as Prince Eric. I wish we could have gotten to know his personality a little better. The rest of the talented cast includes Melissa McCarthy, Javier Bardem, Awkwafina, Noma Dumezweni, Daveed Diggs, Jacob Tremblay, Art Malik, and more. Lizzo auditioned for the role of Ursula and even wore an octopus costume. I’m a fan of Melissa McCarthy and thought she did a fine job, even doing all of her own singing after being coached by Eric Vetro. It just made me wonder if Lizzo might have even been a stronger Ursula, certainly in the singing department. Bette Midler would have also been absolutely fantastic (I adore Ms. M), but Disney didn’t even reach out to her. This version honors the original animation while giving new legs to a new generation of little girls who don’t look like the typical Disney Princess of old. It’s so colorful, vibrant, and imaginative. I love all of the undersea creatures and how they interact with Ariel…except the sea snakes. Ick. The costume designer, Colleen Atwood, worked very hard to ensure all of the merpeople had accessories that were actually made from the sea. Disney swapped out the Old English Sheepdog for a Bearded Collie, just like it did in the 2006 movie The Shaggy Dog. We get four new songs in this version. The music was written by Alan Menken, just like in the original, but the lyrics were created by Lin-Manuel Miranda, the talented creator of the huge Broadway hit “Hamilton.” He also did the lyrics for Moana and several other musicals. Fun fact: It took 4 years to film the movie because production had to shut down during the Covid-19 pandemic. THINGS I DIDN’T LIKE: I admit that I’m completely biased in favor of the original The Little Mermaid because I have so many special memories of watching it with my children. That being said, this version isn’t as bad as some people are saying. It just doesn’t have quite the Disney magic and spark as the original…for me. One of the biggest complaints I’ve been hearing about this remake addresses the pacing. I tend to agree. There was no need to make this movie so long. I wish Sebastian’s little face could have been more expressive. If you struggle with vertigo as I do, you might get dizzy during a few scenes when the camera spins through seaweed and coral really fast under the sea. Now as a mother watching this story, it just made me laugh at how quickly and easily Ariel fell in love with someone she had never even met or talked to. Some of the mermaids look super CGI. I was sad that two songs from the original animation were removed: “Daughters of Triton” and “Les Poissons.” Sadly, also missing is the adorable Chef Louis. Since this is the age of feminism, Scuttle, the male seagull in the original animation is now a female. The song “Scuttlebutt” song was more annoying than charming.

They would kill me within minutes. I did notice that whether my sons had guy friends or girl friends over to hang out, everyone wanted to play it. I spent a lot of money on Nintendo over the years! While critics are not loving this thinly-plotted movie adaptation, fans are giving it a big thumbs up and being swept away by the nostalgia. Because the game has been so beloved for four decades, the pressure was definitely on to get it right. The film was directed by Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic. The script was written by Matthew Fogel. THINGS I LIKED: The fantastic voice talent includes Chris Pratt, Anya Taylor-Joy, Jack Black, Seth Rogen, Keegan-Michael Key, Charlie Day, Fred Armisen, Sebastian Maniscalco, and Kevin Michael Richardson.

Adults who have never played the game won’t be as interested, deciding it’s just a whole lot of color and noise like a cartoon that plays on the TV while the kids engage with other toys and activities in the same room. The plot is very simple and thin. I agree with the critics. The story doesn’t move the scenes forward. Instead, the scenes exist for fan service with a weak plot that stitches them together. Some of the songs don’t quite fit the video game but will resonate with older fans of the Nintendo era. I wanted to see all of the details in the backgrounds, but they were usually blurred out.

A good continuation of the story. Characters are well written.'), ('8', ""The previous film, Scream V, was surprisingly enjoyable. It came out 11 years after Scream 4 and it was the first to not be directed by Wes Craven. It felt like it shouldn't have worked, but it did! Now after a significantly smaller gap of just 1 year, we have another instalment in the Scream franchise. Does it continue to be a slashing entry or is this going to be the first to fall flat on its face? Firstly, I love the change in setting for this film. Bringing the franchise out of Woodsboro made this a more interesting entry. We get to see Ghostface kill in the city and that leads to a lot of interesting set pieces. A memorable one was Ghostface hiding amongst other Halloween people on a subway. These scenes are incredibly tense and suspenseful. I also love how brutal this new Ghostface is. The way they stab their victims, hunt the main characters and hurt anyone in their way is unsettling. The opening scene was also a terrific way of subverting expectations. The mystery surrounding the new Ghostface is engaging and effective in its execution. Neve Campbell does not return as Sidney for the first time in the series due to a pay dispute which is a shame. However, I think the way her character is handled is done respectfully. Her absence leads to a focus on the characters from Scream V and it makes the film a lot better. On that note, Melissa and Jenna return as Sam and Tara respectively from Scream V and I liked them more here. I liked how both characters handled the traumatic events in that film. Sam is very cautious and protective of her sister since the event but Tara just wants to move on. I especially enjoyed Sam's struggle with her inner darkness which was hinted at in the previous film. The surviving supporting cast from Scream V also has more depth this time with their friendship with Sam and Tara being more meaningful. Courteney Cox returns as Gale and despite being a small role, she has an enjoyable and tense scene with Ghostface. The biggest surprise was Hayden Panettiere returning as Kirby from Scream 4. The last we saw of her was her getting stabbed and bleeding out so it was a surprise to see her alive. I enjoyed seeing how she also changed since Scream 4. She is more hardened and resolved but unlike with Sidney, it's hard to tell if it is truly genuine or if she is Ghostface. Nevertheless, I do have some issues with it. My biggest is characters surviving fatal wounds. Some characters would get stabbed in the gut and leg but still have loads of energy to fight with no issues. You could argue that it is Adrenaline but it is kind of weird. Some characters survive getting stabbed dozens of times which is just plain ridiculous. It felt like they were scared to kill off characters. The story also relies on plot conveniences and incompetent cops. The Ghostface is hunting our main characters and none of the police think to stay with them. Once it is revealed who is Ghostface, their plan feels a bit ridiculous and also feels like it could have easily been uncovered if anyone from the police or FBI weren't dumb. Overall, Scream continues to deliver refreshing movies in the slasher genre. 6 movies in and there isn't a terrible movie in the franchise. I hope whatever future entry this franchise has, that continues to do something new and exciting.""), ('0', 'More woke propaganda in almost every scene. Very early on, a black lesbian and a chinese lesbian scold a straight, white male for making a move on a consenting girl, even though in the previous scene a woman proudly celebrated the fact that she sleeps with multiple men and later calls it \'sex positive.\' Needless to say, she was also the strong, dominant one and the man was the needy one. We have women wearing ""I\'m a strong woman"" T-shirts as well as trans people walking the streets in the background. Almost every character is of colour except all the bad guys, who are predictably, white. On a separate note, Courtney Cox\'s top lip looks about as stiff as the corpses being left behind by the killer. Monika from friends now looks like that recent picture of Madonna, where she looks like the Jigsaw Killer from \'Saw.\' Accordingly, I now call her \'Madonika.\' Coming up with that name was the best part of this film. Unsurprisingly, she is also dating someone black, meaning that not one same-race couple exists in this film, as though it doesn\'t exist in real life. Objectively, apart from the woke agenda, the film is average at best. Most people giving it high scores weren\'t even born when the original came out and don\'t know what good cinema looks like.

Opening up with two wannabe rookies trying to pull off ghostface leads to a ghostface with a shotgun!. The story takes it all up a notch with good writing,nice soundtrack and really the best part, messier,harsher and more gruesome kills with blood spilled everywhere to match the vibe that a masked killer should give. Creating an enjoyable cat and mouse game while showing old faces too like Courteney  Cox and Hayden Panettiere that climaxes to a cheesy and unrealistic though acceptable final act. taking the old story and tricks to the new world and trying to keep it alive,with more knives and stabs and succeed,but not in every aspect.

THINGS I LIKED: The lineup of actors is fantastic and includes Paul Dano, Pete Davidson, Vincent D’Onofrio, America Ferrera, Nick Offerman, Anthony Ramos, Seth Rogen, Talia Ryder, Sebastian Stan, Shailene Woodley, Myha’la Herrold, Clancy Brown, and so many more. They created quirky, fun characters, and all did an outstanding job. Remember the Winklevoss twins in the movie The Social Network? They’re two of the executive producers for this movie. They got into a legal battle with Mark Zuckerberg, which was written about in the book “The Accidental Billionaires” written by Ben Mezrich. Ben Mezrich also wrote the book “The Antisocial Network”, which is what inspired this movie. I thought it was funny that the waitress knew about stocks and investing. Who doesn’t love a good underdog movie, especially when people who are struggling in the economy can stick it to the “Man”? The movie does a great job illustrating the nuances of living in a pandemic. Even if you don’t completely understand the investment world, you’ll still enjoy the story that shows the “little guy” beating out supposedly smarter Wall Street experts. Thanks to a real-life video clip by Steven Colbert, the film explains what a short sale or short squeeze is. There is a lot of spoken and visual humor. We get to see video clips of the real people involved in these events at the end of the movie THINGS I DIDN’T LIKE: The real Ken Griffin is entrenched in a lawsuit over how his character has been portrayed by Nick Offerman in the film. There are so many characters to try to keep track of. Some viewers have complained that this movie has come out too soon. Do you agree?

Haunted Mansion,2023-07-28,movie,123,47,4.6,"{('3', 'Hmm, this one its really bad even if you compare it with the old movie who was also kinda bad, waste of time and money. Trash humor and jokes, boring situations.'), ('5', ""Haunted Mansion is Disney's second attempt at making a movie based on the titled ride. The 2003 version starring Eddie Murphy was critically not well received and flopped at the box office. However, it has a cult following nowadays and honestly, it's a decently fun movie. Does this second attempt deliver more or is it just another failed attempt at turning another ride into the next Pirates of the Caribbean? One of the biggest things you will get out of this film is how amazing Lakeith Stanfield is as the main lead. He delivers a standout performance with some genuinely strong emotional performance from him. This is thanks to how his character is written. It is surprising to see Disney have an adult character dealing with loss and still grieving from it. He is also an introverted character with anxiety issues which is not something you see a lot from main characters in big IPs. His character is the heart and most engaging element. His character development is a wonderful thing to watch. The exploration of grief is well-done and it's a meaningful theme to explore in a family film. The cast also all have decent chemistry. Owen Wilson just steals a lot of the scene with his charisma. Danny Devito is a bundle of joy as usual. Tiffany Haddish is good during the more serious and emotional stuff but her comedy is a mixed bag. Rosario Dawson is mostly serious but it works fine. It is at its most enjoyable when the cast is bouncing off each other. Jamie Lee Curtis has a minor role as Madame Leota but she does great with her small screen time. The first act started strong with some decent horror and tension. Some of the scares are pretty surprising for a movie that is also aimed at kids. There are also some great visual sequences. For example, the door opening to a sea or the hallways becoming longer or the pictures starting to move behind the character's back. Unfortunately, it becomes pretty bland after the initial strong start. The second and third act start ditching any of the horror energy and becomes an adventure movie. It becomes reliant on jump scares but none of them are really that effective. The plot is also very standard and forgettable. There isn't any interesting character development for other characters nor is there any great twist or revelations in the plot. It doesn't help that this movie tries to be a PG13 horror but also a comedy and is not good at either. There are so many silly jokes and dialogue that just don't land. It didn't even give me a chuckle. The movie is 2 hours and that is too long. There are many moments where the pacing is just slow or where scenes drag on longer than necessary or there is a pointless padding scene. 20 minutes could have been easily cut out of this film which would no doubt help the pacing. I'm also saddened by how reliant this movie is on CGI. A lot of the ghosts are CGI and the effects are CGI, all of which are very noticeable. It's a shame as most of these could have been done practically and look way better for it. It baffles me that the main antagonist is CGI. Could they not get Jared Leto in prosthetics or something? Also, there are so many noticeable product placements as well. There are so many dialogues where characters randomly mention products for no reason. For example, a character mentions getting a mansion from Zillow or getting stuff from Costco. The biggest offender was during a serious moment and the character mentions Baskin Robbins which took me out of the moment. Overall, Haunted Mansion 2023 is a decent second attempt. It's not amazing or that memorable and it's not better or worse than the 2003 version. It's an okay movie but I definitely expected better from a movie with Disney money. I do want to see what ride they adapt into a movie next, Expedition Everest perhaps?""), ('2', 'A very poor movie. It\'s not funny, it\'s not scary, it\'s not moving although it tries a few times. Boring, generic, without flair. Kids will get bored, adults too, this movie is for nobody. Generic characters, generic story, lots of fillers, too long... Even good actors fail to deliver. CGI like in ""Ghostbustes"" from 1984. This is bad even for D+ streaming.'), ('2', 'The Disney gravy train continues, and if it’s not another live action remake it’s a theme park ride adaptation. Well although these theme park movies have served them well in the past (5 Pirates of the Caribbean movies, Jungle Cruise etc.), they’ve now had a go at a spooky tale suitable for the whole family. Well that was the idea but unfortunately this new Haunted Mansion movie will be too scary for some young viewers and too boring for everyone else. Not even a strong cast made up of LaKeith Stanfield, Rosario Dawson, Owen Wilson, Tiffany Haddish, Danny DeVito, and Jamie Lee Curtis is enough to save this snooze-fest. A single mother, Gabbie (Rosario Dawson) moves into a lovely mansion that unfortunately is also home to a whole bunch of ghosts. Enter a tour guide (LaKeith Stanfield) a priest (Owen Wilson), a psychic (Tiffany Haddish) and a historian (Danny DeVito) to all get together and help exorcise the ghosts from the Haunted Mansion. An unlikely group of heroes forced together in a very unusual circumstance that should have resulted in a comedic spooky tale but ends up as a bland, boring story that I couldn’t wait to be finally over. This isn’t the worst film I’ve seen all year but it’s close. Haunted Mansion fails at a family comedy and fails as a spooky ghost story. It’s got a dull script that even a good cast can’t do anything with. The effects are horrendous, you’d see better looking ghosts in a PS2 game. It can’t fit comfortably into a genre because it’s not funny and not scary. This felt endless and I can’t believe it’s only two hours because it felt more like four. The idea was good and clearly there’s lots to work with from the theme park ride, as all these ghosts with different back stories keep showing up throughout the film. There’s certainly enough of them stuffed into it and perhaps it would have been better as a mini series to explore some of the different ghost tales and actually develop some characters instead of quickly jamming them altogether into the mansion as quick as possible with the 999 other ghosts before the really evil ghost completes his plan of collecting 1000 souls. Haunted Mansion moves from one haunted room to another, leaving you feeling like you’d rather be in the haunted mansion ride itself rather than this. Hell even those little crappy ghost trains we all got dragged to at some point as a child is better than this because it’s over quicker. I went in with low expectations and I was still disappointed. Haunted Mansion is a wasted opportunity because with that cast it should have been a hell of a lot better than the result. And it’s really not their fault, without a good script you don’t have a good movie and if Disney put an actual film maker in charge of things they might end up with better material because they’ve long since shown themselves to be completely out of ideas. Too bad they can’t understand the importance of good writers and yet another mediocre theme park based movie only serves as a further reminder that originality died at Disney years ago. We’re entering spooky season now and there are so many better things you could watch instead of this utter mess, Casper, The Nightmare Before Christmas, The Addams Family, Coraline, Beetlejuice and of course Hocus Pocus. Honestly there’s episodes of Scooby-Doo that are more entertaining than Haunted Mansion. But for anyone genuinely looking for a not too scary Halloween movie for the whole family, check out any of the above and skip this utter mess of a movie because there’s very few people I’d recommend this to. Haunted Mansion is recommended for die-hard fans of the theme park, I’m not saying you’ll all enjoy it but if this movie was made for anyone, it’s you guys. For everyone else, I’d say skip this one.'), ('3', 'Wish I could ask Disney why this film was made and who for.

Bob Iger hates the fact that people are vilifying him over his 'counter offer' to the union, which was just the old offer. In order to pay the demands of the unions on strike, Bob would need to allocate around 1% of the annual profits the massively successful studio makes. Bob Iger is just an L walking in a suit held up by sheer incompetence, AI could actually do his job better for significantly cheaper.""), ('3', ""The movie is based on an exciting attraction and was promoted as an entertaining action comedy.

Offers some solid actors and a few chuckles.'), ('7', 'A pretty good movie with some good laughs sprinkled through out. It’s a refreshing new perspective on the Haunted Mansion as its focus is shifted elsewhere (plot-wise); so while watching it I hardly thought about the original.

After watching this movie twice now I’ve realized it’s a fantastic movie. As far as the spooky genre it’s a perfect movie. The acting is really strong, the special effects are A plus and the over all story is well crafted and surprisingly deep. the director didn’t have much under his belt outside of very progressive material and it’s cool to see a talented film maker branch out and create something for everyone with a timeless nature. I don’t ever review movies but this deserves one because the meta rating is much lower than a film of this caliber should deserve. It will achieve cult status in the spooky season genre no doubt. A lot of people will discover it in the coming days and enjoy it immensely. What it might lack in shock gore it makes up for in solid acting and it’s ability to get people to relate on an emotional level revolving loss, longing, and acceptance.

Green screen visuals were a bit obvious at times but it had great character and LaKeith was an absolute standout!'), ('1', ""Why did this cost 150 million dollars when it really doesn't show disney truly has a spending issue and suffers from remake fatigue and wants everyone else to suffer as well.""), ('7', 'IN A NUTSHELL: Featuring the iconic attraction at Disneyland, this story is about a single mother and son who move into a house, only to discover it is haunted. They recruit the help of a tour guide, psychic, priest, and historian only to learn there is much more to the ghosts than anyone was prepared for. THINGS I LIKED: If you love the Haunted Mansion ride at Disneyland, you’ll love all of the scenes that honor the spirit of that fan favorite. So many Easter eggs to enjoy! The cast includes reliable fan favorites too: Jared Leto, Jamie Lee Curtis, Owen Wilson, Danny DeVito, Tiffany Haddish, LaKeith Stanfield, and Rosario Dawson. We’re also treated to the young Chase W. Dillon, who might be new to some viewers. They all do a great job. The special effects that make the ghosts look truly ghostly worked really well to resemble what we see in the famous ride at the theme park. The name of the mansion, Gracey Manor, is to honor Yale Gracey, a Disney Imagineer who originated the illusion of the ghosts flying around the dining room table in the theme park. Lots of humor with snarky dialogue and physical gags. The film does a great job showcasing the unique vibe of New Orleans. It’s very different from the 2003 film of the same name. The sound effects are terrific. You really hear all of the creaks you would expect in a haunted house. There is a lot of action, but it’s blended well with touching moments and heart. Each of the characters gets the spotlight at least once and experiences some growth. That’s impressive for an ensemble cast. THINGS I DIDN’T LIKE: It’s a bit too long. Some viewers are complaining the movie isn’t scary enough, but I disagree. Disneyland was originally created for families, so I don’t think the film should be too scary. Guillermo del Toro was originally involved and, if he had remained, I have no doubt this movie would have been scarier! Not all of the jokes land. A lot of the talented actors are underutilized. A lot of the action sequences are chaotic. Why wasn’t this movie released closer to Halloween?

Saltburn,2023-11-17,movie,131,60,7.0,"{('8', 'Saltburn very much feels like The Talented Mr. Ripley on steroids. Emerald Fennell has gifted us with another thrilling cinematic experience that for right or wrong reasons will stay with you long after it’s over. Put it this way, you’re never going to be able to listen to Murder on the Dancefloor again without thinking of Saltburn. Oliver Quick (Barry Keoghan) finds himself drawn to the charming and aristocratic Felix Catton (Jacob Elordi) while studying at Oxford. Oliver is the black sheep, a scholarship boy among the world’s elites and he is determined to make it clear he belongs. Oliver and Felix could not come from more different worlds. As Oliver becomes more and more enchanted by Felix he is determined to embed himself in the lavish lifestyle and an invitation to his family’s castle, Saltburn changes his life forever. I’d heard some contrasting reactions to Saltburn after it’s previews at the film festivals, but with Emerald Fennell directing and a cast made up of Barry Keoghan, Rosamund Pike, Richard E. Grant and Carey Mulligan I was sold no matter what the reactions. And well now having seen it, I get why it wouldn’t work for some people but I was absolutely enthralled. It’s shocking in more ways than one and the story itself will captivate the audience. It’s one of those movies that unfolds in such a way that you really can’t look away no matter how you feel about it. Saltburn is a spectacularly crafted story that emulates The Talented Mr. Ripley and Alfred Hitchcock. Very dark, and very twisted, the perfect film for those with a weird sense of humour. Murder on the Dancefloor is right because Barry Keoghan absolutely killed it. He continues to cement himself as one of this generations greatest actors. Giving a performance that again pushes the boundaries and yes I’ve The Killing of a Sacred Deer but honestly he gets better in every new movie. He was perfect casting for this role in Saltburn, and alongside Jacob Elordi together they have incredible chemistry and a great onscreen presence. All the characters are fascinating in their own way, particularly the completely out of touch elites and the contrast between the classes. This becomes progressively heightened as Oliver feels more and more like he doesn’t belong to this lifestyle. I loved the gothic vibes running throughout the movie, everything from the dramatic score, the gorgeous cinematography and the stunning location. A satirical comedy on class with a sinister tone and packed full of black humour, Saltburn is sharp, outlandish and hilarious. I’d strongly recommend this to anyone who enjoyed Promising Young Woman or Triangle of Sadness. It certainly got a reaction from the crowd I saw it with and sure it’s a messed up movie but by the time it ends you won’t forget it any time soon.'), ('3', 'Sometimes you come across a filmmaker whose works you just don’t like. And now, after two features in, I can honestly say that about writer-director Emerald Fennell. I didn’t care much for her debut outing, “Promising Young Woman” (2020), and I can say the same (and more) about her follow-up effort, “Saltburn.” This alleged thriller about a seemingly awkward but quietly sinister Oxford student (Barry Keoghan) who ingratiates himself into a family of wealthy English aristocrats features a story and characters about whom, quite frankly, I couldn’t care less. (Think “The Killing of a Sacred Deer” (2017) with a cast of eccentric old money cronies and a wolf in sheep’s clothing.) This assemblage of utterly reprehensible characters living utterly reprehensible lives and zealously adhering to utterly reprehensible values fails to endanger viewer empathy, interest or even connection. Much of the narrative is predictable and glacially paced, incorporates sequences that are included for little more than forced shock value, features monodimensional and blatantly obvious (almost trite) character development, and frequently stumbles in attempts at humor that are wedged in largely for the sake of convenience or calculatedly timed comic relief. It’s the kind of picture that prompts regular looks at one’s watch to see how much more one must endure and delivers welcome sighs of relief when the end finally comes. What’s more, given the combined talent pool for this production, it’s a genuine shame to see the likes of Rosamund Pike, Carey Mulligan and Richard E. Grant relegated to supporting roles in which their abilities are sorely underused. And then there’s the excessively hammy performance of Keoghan, who’s quite obviously (and knowingly) acting and not disappearing into the bona fide portrayal of a character. In all, this offering feels like a picture that tries awfully hard to see how much it can get away with, especially when seeking to invoke dropped jaws among audience members, much as this director’s cinematic predecessor attempted to do. Save your money, and don’t waste your time on this vastly overrated release from a vastly overrated filmmaker.'), ('7', 'Very strange movie. Overall I thought it was still enjoyable and the acting top notch. 3rd act was a little weak though. And the main characters personality change from the first 2 acts was kind of abrupt and unprompted.'), ('6', ""Wow... Get ready for one wild ride with this one. A seemingly lower class and awkward young Oxford student named Oliver (Barry Keoghan) finds himself befriending a privileged and wealthy fellow student named Felix (Jacob Elordi), who takes him under his wing and invites him to his family's sprawling estate during summer break. From there, wild parties and debauchery ensue as Oliver starts acting increasingly disturbed, deranged, and attached to Felix's family. Written and directed by Emerald Fennell (who won an Oscar for her screenplay with her 2020 directorial debut 'Promising Young Woman'), this is a film that was absolutely full of twists, turns, and equally shocking and sickening moments throughout. I genuinely had no idea where things would lead or might happen next throughout the whole thing, but unfortunately this couldn't quite make up for the overall sleaziness of it all, as I found myself more often than not feeling like I needed a shower after watching several scenes, which says a lot for me. Furthermore, it felt as though the film was simply borrowing too heavily from earlier and more superior films. There's very much a heavy vibe of both 'The Talented Mr. Ripley' and 'Parasite' sprinkled throughout, both of which did their job better than this film did in my opinion. The biggest highlight I can give this film by far is Keoghan's scarily-convincing sociopathic lead turn here. He completely throws himself into his unhinged character and turns in one of the most demented onscreen performances I've seen in quite some time. For those familiar with his unsettling supporting performance in 'The Killing of a Sacred Deer', trust me when I say that you ain't seen nothing from him yet until you've watched him in this. There's a VERY good reason Matt Reeves cast him as the new Joker in his upcoming Batman sequel FYI. Aside from him, Elordi plays his usual charming and boyish jock self here to great effect, and other supporting players, such as Rosemund Pike and Richard E. Grant also deliver. Overall, for better or worse, I was left heavily shaken and totally disturbed by the end of this one. It's full of surprises, sleazy as hell, and led by an absolutely phenomenal and unsettling Keoghan. It's a film that will haunt me for the foreseeable future, but left me feeling admittedly rather icky, and isn't necessarily one I'd want to revisit.""), ('8', 'Thoroughly enjoyed this film. Dark doesn’t even begin to describe it. So many great lines that had me laughing out loud. Terrific performances from all the cast.

Keoghan is riveting in every scene and I can't wait to see where his career goes from here.""), ('8', 'Wow. A very bold take on class, obsession and sex. Barry Keoghan is so committed to the depravity and physical shock. Rosamund Pike was outstanding and hilarious! I was so uncomfortable watching this; in a good way. I laughed, I cringed, I was moved and even charmed.'), ('2', ""Does what other movies have done before it better. Not much happens and you don't end up caring about anyone. The shock factor also wasn't worth it/good and the ending was terrible.""), ('6', ""Confronted with such a foreseeable storyline, Saltburn goes for the equally predictable style over substance.Based on all the buzz surrounding this movie, I had pretty much anticipated where I was getting myself into, so what intrigued me most about its narrative was to see if there would be some kind of flashier twist, but that never materializes. That doesn't necessarily imply something negative; a story can be told multiple times and still captivate an audience, and Saltburn pulls it off, with incredible restraint, but it does. After all, watching you invite a cancer into your home and consume its inhabitants one by one, remains a subtly gripping and entertaining experience, even if it lacks surprises or fails to create a lasting impression — though, I admit, it does looks nice. Moreover, it reaffirms what a great actor Barry Keoghan is destined to become.""), ('9', 'Coming into this, all I knew of Emerald Fennel was her work on Killing Eve’s second season, which I found pleasantly sharp and surprisingly dark. She seems to have dialed up her eccentric, picturesque love of the macabre to a whole other scale for ‘Saltburn.’ For only her second feature film, it’s remarkably confident in what its showing, growing bolder and bolder by the scene. The start and end of the movie feel like two entirely separate entities. But the progression feels very organic, or as organic as you can get in an insane bats**t Fennel screenplay. The weaving of one genre tone to the other should feel jarring given how satirical this movie gets at times, but it pulls you back in with another emotional gut tug. By the end, if you’re not too emotionally whipped by this British middle-class beast, it may be worth thinking if Fennel has a second Oscar nom on the horizon. I certainly won’t be complaining.'), ('8', ""Barry Keoghan made strong impressions in The Killing of a Sacred Deer & The Banshees of Inisherin. His nuanced, intense portrayal in this film solidifies his place as one of the most gifted character actors of his generation.

Thus begin the awkward and unusual encounters with this eccentric group (led by a wonderfully wicked Rosamund Pike as the matriarch). Writer/director Emerald Fennell (Promising Young Woman & Midge in Barbie and Camilla in The Crown) has infused the film with peculiar people, interesting camerawork and unexpected moments. There's an underlying dark humor and uncomfortable ambiance that keeps twisting the story, but it's Koeghan's impressive performance that's the movie's most compelling asset""), ('6', 'Following ""Promising Young Woman"", which indicted straight men as predators, Emerald Fennell presents ""Saltburn"", which loathes non-straight men as graspers and connivers.

Twelve years later, Nora and Hae Song reconnect through the miracle of social media. Their relationship becomes a series of video calls where the sense of connection is palpable.

Another twelve years later, Hae Song decides to vacation in New York City. It’s an opportunity for him to see a now-married Nora face-to-face for the first time in twenty-four years. It’s all sweet, sad and thoughtful. In the process, this film offers more observations about the human condition than any film in recent memory. Several elements make this film outstanding. The cast is pitch perfect. As the adult Nora, Greta Lee (“The Morning Show,” “Russian Doll,” Will Aronson’s musical “My Scary Girl”) is mesmerizing. She blends her well-honed comic timing with a sincerity and vulnerability that are irresistible. As Hae Song, Teo Yoo (“Leto,” “Decision to Leave”) is equally impressive. You can often read his emotions without a word having to be spoken. John Magaro (“The Big Short,” “First Cow”) has a smaller but still essential role as Nora’s husband, Arthur.

Song deftly uses her story to explore a variety of themes – the nature of relationships, the immigrant experience, the necessary balance between work and relationships, the role of fate (and the Korean concept of “in-yun”). She does it all in an unhurried style that makes “Past Lives” feel similar to Richard Linklater’s “Before” trilogy. It’s my guess this film will be equally well-loved and critically regarded. What’s most surprising here is Song’s self-confidence as a first-time filmmaker, given that she has the additional responsibility of being true to her own story. Many of the story elements of “Past Lives” are autobiographical. Song emigrated from Korea to Canada at age 12. She, like Nora, is a playwright. She currently lives in New York City with a husband she met on a writer’s retreat, like her character. Realizing and respecting the power of her story, Song infuses this film with an unhurried pace that allows real emotions to develop and well-earned insights to come to the surface. Song has the self-confidence to highlight the power of words left unspoken. She uses her technique to convey the insurmountable gulf between two characters who, paradoxically, are standing two feet apart. Like many of the best films, “Past Lives” will serve as an incentive for self-reflection for many moviegoers. You’ll leave the theater pondering the arc of your own story and the crucial “what-ifs” that have affected your own journey. “Past Lives” is a powerful, evocative experience for any moviegoer with a beating heart.'), ('9', 'Beautifully crafted and filmed movie that touches on chance encounters as well as meaningful exchanges that alter the course of our lives but occasionally we can reflect back on without remorse. Well cast.'), ('9', ""It's been quite a while since my theater was left in completely silent shock by the end.""), ('10', 'The theme of love has been raised in the cinema many times. And this topic will always be relevant as long as man exists. But the question is how to show and convey excitement through the screen and what emotions you feel.

The authors touched me to the core.'), ('10', 'Watching this deeply personal and meditative film will go down as one of the very best moviegoing experiences I have enjoyed in recent years.

It is instead a thoughtful, humane rumination on what may be fixed in personal history but remains forever fluid in the mind.'), (10.0, 'However you write its title, Past Lives is a great romance, a great coming-of-age story, a great tale about the ways technology can bring people together (but only so far), a great New York City film, a great story about immigrants — and a great movie, period.'), (10.0, 'Song masterfully simplifies things on an emotional level, allowing us to switch back and forth between feelings or simply to meditate on the outcome we wish for, and to understand why it’s OK if we don’t get it.'), (10.0, 'Song has crafted a deliriously honest romantic drama that is utterly singular even while it calls to mind everything from Richard Linklater to Wong Kar-wai to David Lean’s Brief Encounter. This is a movie that flows over with patience, forgiveness, and tender wisdom — qualities all the more wondrous for their relative absence from modern society and its movies.'), (10.0, 'It’s a rare movie that settles, quietly, into some part of your own experiences and memories without a speck of narrative contrivance gumming up your response to the story on the screen. Past Lives is that rarity.'), (10.0, 'It is not a failed love story, but it is a lost love story, as its characters fall victim to the realities of time and circumstance and are left wondering what may have been if either of those things had been different.'), (10.0, 'It’s difficult to convey the multilayered beauty of Past Lives beyond just urging people to see it and lose themselves in its transfixing spell.'), (10.0, 'Past Lives is an exquisitely wistful drama that speaks with an honesty so affectingly crisp it will turn your conceptions of love, identity and fate on their head.'), (10.0, 'Emotionally engaging from the start, bolstered by brilliant performances and held together by Song’s understated direction that weaves timelines together flawlessly, it’s more than just good.'), (10.0, 'A movie that liberates your tears and makes you fall in love with it. It is almost assuredly predestined to be the single best movie you see this year.'), (10.0, 'Song’s work here is incredible, as this story of the past and present, and what it means for the future is a carefully handled story told with love and heart.

Transformers: Rise of the Beasts,2023-06-09,movie,127,42,5.4,"{('8', 'IN A NUTSHELL: Steven Caple Jr. directs this 7th addition to the Transformers franchise. Writing credits go to Joby Harold, Darnell Metayer, Josh Peters, Erich Hoeber, and Jon Hoeber. During the ‘90s, a new faction of Transformers – the Maximals – join the Autobots as allies in the battle for Earth. THINGS I LIKED: The cast is fantastic and includes Anthony Ramos (I love him!), Ron Perlman (voice), Academy Award winner Michelle Yeoh (voice), Pete Davidson (voice), Dominique Fishback, and young Dean Scott Vazquez. The lead characters’ stories immediately make you want to root for them. The emotional connection between the Transformers is also significant. You get action from the very first scene and plenty more later on. Impressive set pieces. Lots of humor. Not all of it lands, but I appreciated the effort. Poppin music. We get to go to Peru! The luscious, green landscapes mixed with terraced stones and wide fields make for the perfect backdrop and setting for more battle sequences. Throw in a little bit of Inca legend, and you’ve got something interesting. If you’ve ever seen the TV series “Beast Wars: Transformers (1996), then you’ll recognize the Maximals, which can transform into animals. Optimus Prime is a 1987 Freightliner FLA semi-truck in this movie. There are some entertaining, new robots that are immediately likeable. Shout-out to New York City grit. Compared to the Michael Bay movies that had dizzying, grinding action sequences that were too close-up to see well, I thought the direction of this film was much better. The last few Transformer movies were real stinkers, but this one worked, cliched as it was. The CGI is very good. We get a LOT of different kinds of Transformers. The ending lets you know you’re not going to have to wait too long for a sequel to this story. Yep, the Transformers franchise is not dead. THINGS I DIDN’T LIKE: Because they have to keep reinventing worlds, there is, necessarily, a LOT of exposition so the audience can understand what’s going on. So much explaining! It always makes me laugh when the Transformers have massive battles out in the open, yet no other humans see or hear anything. The plot is extremely simple, sandwiched by lots of battles and destruction. Some of the story details are filled with predictable tropes and others don’t make sense but try not to overthink everything and you’ll enjoy it just fine. If you don’t like Transformer movies to begin with, don’t bother with this one. Some fans are loving this new addition, but it’s probably not going to convince you otherwise. There’s a short scene when Dominique Fishback starts to sing and I was REALLY hoping that Anthony Ramos would sing with her, but he doesn’t. Missed opportunity! I absolutely loved him in Hamilton and In the Heights. He is so talented! First, Optimus Prime. Now, Optimus Primal. Seriously? It felt a lot like the very first Transformers movie but without the novelty. TIPS FOR PARENTS: A mother swears and her son scolds her saying, “Language!” There is some additional, “mild” profanity. Some Spanish is spoken without subtitles. One line is crude. Lots of destruction. Lots of violence and fighting. People and creatures are in dangerous situations. A boy has Sickle Cell'), ('7', ""Story execution-Good 7/10 Pacing-Pretty good 7/10 Character writing-ok, but can be improved on 6/10 Visuals:Perfect!!!!! 10/10 Voice acting-All of them did amazing 9/10 Music-Ok, but there's not much else for me to vibe with 6/10 Theme execution-Pretty good, even if it is cliche 7/10 Verdict:Its a good movie, go watch it if ur ok wjth fine execution of a cliche movie 7.4/10""), ('10', 'Finally a transformer movie without in your face product placement.

Its filled with a pushed agenda of political opinions and woke talk about race I think every conversation the characters had was a sign of this and made every interaction with the actors terrible and unbearable to watch. The fighting scenes and CGI is worse then in 2007 I don't know how they managed to do this but because of this movie i treasure the 2007 movie.""), ('7', ""I have to say I really enjoyed this, a great nostalgia trip and there's nothing wrong with that. It's the first live action Transformers movie I've seen and I feel like it carried some of the feeling of the old animated series while also having a nice modern/retro style mix. The writing is not up to much but but it somehow didn't iritate me in the way that it did in e.g. Avatar WoW. Overall, I think if you have nostalgia for Transformers I think it's and enjoyable movie but otherwise it may not be your cup of tea. My girlfriend and I enjoyed the scenes from Cusco and Machu Picchu, since we had just visited there a fee months ago, so that was a nice bonus for us!"")}","{(6.9, 'Transformers: Rise of the Beasts keeps it simple enough, which is smart, because franchise creep is going to hit like a ton of bricks within a sequel or two, especially given its ending.

Coming off that, Rise of the Beasts feels like both a step forward and a step back.'), (7.3, 'Where Bay’s movies where incoherent messes that necessitated heaps of migraine meds, Caple Jr. actually manages to pull off something articulate and rousing with “Rise of the Beasts,” thanks in large part to the ever-relatable presences of Fishback and Ramos, and a parting note that’s just witty enough in its suggestion of a bigger universe.'), (6.3, 'It’s still a movie about giant space robots talking trash and smashing into each other, but Transformers: Rise of the Beasts is better than most offerings in the franchise.'), (6.3, 'You know what’s not bad?

It should come with a different sort of content advisory: No one over 21 admitted without their inner child.'), (6.0, 'Sixteen years on from the Shia LaBeouf original, though, the many brains behind this franchise have still to figure out how to satisfy an audience without leaving it bludgeoned.'), (7.5, ""The newest Transformers film, Rise of the Beasts, is a genuinely entertaining summer blockbuster, with its high point being Pete Davidson as Mirage. Highlighting a voice performance as the best quality of a film like Rise of the Beasts could be seen as damning with faint praise, but that's not the case here.

Trying to sum up this film\'s content in a binary, black or white, way or description is virtually impossible. So much of this film, it\'s humor, it\'s dramatic moments, it\'s more emotional moments, simply can\'t be classified as ""basic"". This is a very funny movie, this is a very dark and depressing movie, it is a very thought provoking movie. And it is also very strange. To some, it could be infuriatingly strange. But I think to others, this movie could bring up a lot of alloyed emotions about very sensitive subjects such as trauma, grief, guilt and mental illness.'), ('4', '(Mauro Lanari) Kafka, Lynch, Cronenberg, Burton or Kaufman permitting, it could have been an ""After Hours"" 2.0, Scorsese\'s 1985 film in which the protagonist, a computer programmer, undergoes in retaliation an odyssey in the hallucinating chaotic anomie of existence until he becomes a three-dimensional ""The Scream"" by Munch. The incipit of childbirth and the epilogue of drowning, a sort of return to the amniotic fluid, could appear as a deepening of that cry according to Cioran\'s guidelines: ""The Fall into Time"" (\'64).

I\'ve seen these controlled messes before and sometimes they work (Synechdoche NY by Kaufman) and sometimes they just fall flat on their faces (Cloud Atlas by Wachowskis). You gotta admire the depth Aster goes into on this big fat metaphors and slices of life condensed. Lot\'s of great Oedipal metaphors, mixed with \'seize the day\' moods. I just had a blast deconstructing it. But at the end of the day it doesn\'t tie up nicely with a bow (or Beau, if you will, haha) like something like Kaufman would make. And also at the end of the day, we have to remember that we\'re dealing with a horror director here. So it\'s not quite as ""heady"" as it looks. But we\'ve got some fabulous editing, great mixed media, a different kind of Phoenix shows up for this one, more subdued and quirky than ever, with a supporting cast that does just that, and does it well. Like I said, I would love to give this film a 9. And were it directed or re-written by someone like Charlie Kaufman, maybe it\'d get there?

The film was written and directed by the extremely creative Ari Aster. The film is brought to us by A24, a studio known for its unusual work. THINGS I LIKED: The movie had me at Joaquin Phoenix. He’s amazing and deserves all of the many awards he has received over the years. The terrific cast also includes Tony Award winner Nathan Lane, Amy Ryan, Parker Posey, Tony and Grammy award-winning Patti LuPone, and Zoe Lister-Jones. Director Aster definitely plays the long game with his films. While watching his mindblowing film Midsommar, I was bewildered, shocked, and horrified. In the end, I realized it was extremely clever, although it’s definitely not a movie for everyone’s taste. In this movie, Aster wants the audience to experience what it feels like to live with paranoid, emotional trauma. If you enjoy Charlie Kaufman’s surrealistic style of art, you’ll be intrigued by this film. Otherwise, this is an unusual movie that simply won’t resonate with most viewers. THINGS I DIDN’T LIKE: The director took WAY too long to say what he wanted to say. This is a very long, tiring film. The director described the film as a 4-hour nightmare. It certainly feels like 4 hours but is just under 3 hours, which is still too long and a test of an audience’s endurance, hoping for something amazing to happen. The film is confusing, indulgent, and strange. For me, it was painful to watch, knowing I could spend my time in better ways. Sure, I get the artsy-fartsy pieces and messages, but that doesn’t mean it’s my cup of tea. The music and sound effects were often both hypnotic and annoying. There really isn’t a huge plot; the movie is strung together by experiences that are designed to make you feel a variety of emotions. It made me sad to think that there are probably people out there who are experiencing life like this. Last Fall, I saw several people like that on the streets of Vancouver in Canada. Heartbreaking.

The movie is technically well-made with its visuals and cinematography. Joaquin Phoenix also gives an amusing performance of someone with insane anxiety, Unfortunately, the story is overstuffed and nonsensical. The first hour starts with a lot of intrigue but it becomes almost painfully dull after that. Weird things happen with no rhyme and reason, the multitude of stories and character threads don't connect, and the self-indulgent nature of this whole film. A big issue is the excessive and exhausting 3-hour runtime with its slow pacing. Doesn't help that there are so many scenes of just nothing happening, such as characters walking or sleeping. I give praise for doing a big swing on something original but this time it was a huge miss.""), ('7', 'I walked into this film expecting to leave disoriented or pleasantly surprised, or potentially both. I didn’t particularly like hereditary, but thought Midsommar was a humorous and well crafted film. I refused to watch the trailer so I could experience this film blind with no expectations or foreknowledge of the plot. I’m glad I did.

The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes,2023-11-17,movie,157,54,5.4,"{('6', ""It's much better than I thought it would be - but that's only because I had no idea what the movie would be about walking in. It takes a dark turn, and that was refreshingly interesting! The two leads are solid.""), ('7', ""In 2008, Suzanne Collins took the young adult world by storm with the publication of The Hunger Games, soon turned into a global phenomenon movie franchise with the first entry coming out as early as 2012. With hindsight, it's the political vision infused in The Hunger Games that is most striking. Panem reflects a vision of the United States where a small group of economic, intellectual and artistic elites live extravagantly in rich cities, devoid of true human values, while the rest of the country lives in poverty, working hard and sustaining traditional values and human authenticity. Whether you share this vision or not, it is hard to disagree that it reflected well-ahead of its time a political view that millions of Americans (and others in the world) would embrace a few years later. Now, eight years after the last installment in the series, a prequel is released that tells the origin story of the franchise villain, Coriolanus Snow. Let it be said that the film succeeds in building an engaging story about the development of this character, one that is full of action, excitement and well-crafted character development. However, more than Snow's origin story, it's the origin story of Panem and the Capitol that catches our attention, given the strength of the political message in the first four films. In The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes, we are presented with a Capitol that looks very different from the one seen in the previous films. Instead of the extravagant town reflective of liberal cities in the US, we see a grey city, built in massive concrete structures, that is highly reminiscent of the image we have of Soviet or Eastern European communist cities in the 70's and 80's. The structures, the clothes, the sculptures towering over giant squares, the cars, the propaganda posters are all reflective of communist imagery. That is ultimately the subversive political message infused into this prequel: the behavior and decadence of the Capitol (and by extension of liberal American cities) has its roots in communism. For anyone who understood the political message in the first four films and its connection with some political views in America, this conclusion is not unexpected, but it is certainly a bit disturbing to see it so prominently displayed in such a mass-market oriented movie targeting the young. In the spirit of open-mindedness and democratic values, one can still choose to appreciate and enjoy the film without agreeing with its political message (something many are unable to do these days). There is for example no doubt that the Soviet imagery creates an amazing visual experience, in particular with the representation of a hunger games arena that is visually impactful and very different from the one in previous installments. Ultimately, The Hunger Games is an exciting franchise and this new installment is no exception. And whether you agree with its political vision or not, history has told us that it has had a way of being ahead of its time, and therefore that it is worth listening to.""), ('10', 'It was one of the best movies of the year, I went to see it twice at the cinema, I really loved it'), ('8', 'Great movie and very entertaining, it catches you from the first moment. It’s amazing to know the story of Snow and Lucy Gray and after watching it gives you a newcpoint of view of the old movies. I hope there is more to come of theese characters.'), ('8', ""A genuinely interesting peek into the world of Panem at the beginning of the Hunger Games and the key players that turn it into the spectacle it was once Katniss arrived 64 years later. Tom Blyth is masterful as a Young Snow who made me care about him and his input into the Games and I had no idea that we were due another foray into the Games themselves, which were much more primitive. Rachel Zegler was cute as Lucy Gray but does not a Katniss make, who at times felt more like she was at Judges Houses in X Factor than the Hunger Games. Shout out to Viola Davis who is the star once again, showing there isn't a role she can't make shine. Peter Dinklage needs to stop being offered roles, however. This just brought nostalgia and was engaging, if not a little long, and I hope this is just the first taste in the rise of President Snow on our screen.""), ('7', ""I went into this with low expectations after the mediocre reviews. And I'm not exactly a fan of Zegler. But honestly, it ended up being a lot better than I thought it was going to be. It's a very competent origin story for President Snow. The movie is broken into three parts, each which plays an important role in the development of Snow's character. I was a little worried the movie would focus overmuch on Zegler's character, but it keeps its focus rightfully on Snow. The acting, writing and direction are all great. And it's interesting to see a time when the Capital wasn't omnipotent. It's a stark contrast to the iron grip Snow has in the originals. The only part of the movie I wasn't sold on takes place in the third act. Without going into spoilers, an action by one of the characters (not Snow) isn't sold very well. Doesn't feel like it was earned. Should have spent more time on getting to that point. But perhaps they were feeling like the movie was already overly long and so didn't delve into fully fleshing the transformation. Regardless, it's worth a watch. I was originally on the fence about seeing it in theater or waiting for the release, but I'm glad I went for it in the theater.""), ('10', '""The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes"" masterfully reinvigorates the beloved franchise. Set decades before Katniss Everdeen\'s tale, it explores the early days of the Hunger Games through the eyes of a young Coriolanus Snow.

What the filmmakers are able to show us in only one movie reminded me of Anakin’s plunge into the Dark Side that took place in 3 of the Star Wars films. This movie is directed by Francis Lawrence who also directed 3 of the other Hunger Games movies. It’s designed as a prequel to the 2012 Hunger Games film. It’s supposed to take place 64 years prior. The dramatic film was written by Michael Lesslie, Michael Arndt, and Suzanne Collins. Because they were able to secure an interim agreement from SAG-AFTRA, they were able to market the movie during the 2023 actors’ strike. THINGS I LIKED: Rachel Zegler is so beautiful and has such a lovely voice! She sang all of her songs live on set! I’m excited to see her in Snow White in 2025! She and fellow co-star, Josh Andres Rivera, met while filming the 2021 movie West Side Story together. They’re actually dating in real life! Tom Blyth does a great job as Coriolanus Snow. It’s fascinating to watch the story unfold when we already know how he ends up in later films. Dexter Sol Answell is completely adorable as the young Coriolanus. Academy Award winner Viola Davis won the role of the villain in this prequel after director Francis Lawrence saw a sinister meme of her that a fan had posted online! She’s excellent, of course. I really liked seeing Jason Schwartzman slowly develop the skills he would need later as the flashy Lucretius “Lucky” Flickerman. All of the characters are well defined and it’s easy to quickly feel something for them. The cast includes Peter Dinklage, Burn Gorman, Fionnula Flanagan, Pliny Harrington, Festus Creed, and many more. The set designs are outstanding. Cool special effects. The movie definitely isn’t a musical, yet music plays a big role in the film and perfectly fits the title of the film. I didn’t expect to hear so much music in this! I know, that’s silly since the word “ballad” is in the title! I really enjoyed the musical element in the storyline. It gave a real down-to-earth feeling, and the lyrics showed us how much changed and how much remained the same in the districts. I love that costume designer Trish Summerville included Katniss and Primrose flowers on it as a respectful nod to the previous Hunger Games movies. Nice touch! There are several references to the previous films such as when Lucy Gray curtsies at the ceremony like Katniss did in the 2012 movie. I haven’t read the book, but I hear it’s a very good adaptation! It’s fun to see how the Hunger Games were more amateur in the beginning compared to the glossy veneer they acquired over the decades. THINGS I DIDN’T LIKE: Many of the scenes are visually dark, so it’ll be hard to see everything that’s going on if you watch this on a small streaming device once the film goes to Video on Demand. It seemed ridiculous that Lucy Gray Baird had a beautiful, colorful, and expensive-looking dress while living in a poor district. It was pretty though! Some of the actors deliver lines mechanically. It drove me nuts when Lucy Gray Baird would just sit instead of run away. She seemed super cocky considering she wasn’t a very good fighter. All of the characters looked normal, but Viola Davis was so over the top and seemed out of place. While the movie is a prequel to the original trilogy, it’s not an origin story of the actual Hunger Games. TIPS FOR PARENTS: Violence with various weapons and hand-to-hand combat Explosions and destruction Some blood and gore We see people die. If you don’t like snakes, you’re going to be very uncomfortable watching some of the scenes.'), ('4', 'These films have such a rocky past and this doesn\'t help that at all. It\'s not the worst of the series, part 2 has that crown, but it\'s probably the most disappointing. Its problems definitely reside mostly in ""part 3"" but there\'s problems all over the film. I\'ll try to keep most of the ""spoilers"" to a minimum. The film opens up with just problems, as we\'re supposed to feel bad for our protagonist, who we already know will become a ruthless dictator, because he\'s... poor. We\'re then shown our other protagonist, Lucy gray, who we\'re supposed to care for because... she\'s poor. Interesting strategy here. Snow has more of a backstop at least but Lucy gray has nothing here. Does Snow care about her because she has a pretty face and she sang good? He\'s willing to get to the top at all costs (to save himself and his family from being homeless) but will risk it all, right away, for some random girl he\'s mentoring. There\'s no major conversations with them at all and no chemistry to begin with. She\'s constantly hating on him, rightfully so, and clearly stats she\'s into someone else. Regardless of that, he risks his life for her while sounding like the biggest hypocrite throughout the film. I\'m confused on his motivations throughout the film. The hunger games themselves have some cool stuff in them and the look of the capital was pretty cool. I liked the intriguing nature behind the hunger games and the evolution of it throughout the film. I wanted more of this and less of the relationship mumbo jumbo. The relationship part is easily the worst part and creates problems later on. It\'s unfortunately like 70% of the film. Now the worst part being the third act where charcter motivations are just completely abandoned sometimes then become laughable. It feels like the film should be 4 hours long but reduced because that\'s too long. It\'s extremely rushed to the point of insanity. Maybe the book does a better job at fleshing out the many problems in the movie but the movie does a very bad job at doing it. The movie is one big Shakespeare wannabe that tries so hard to be an epic tragedy but comes off as a tragedy of filmmaking. Overall, I think this world could be a cool idea, but I think movies are too short and narratively strict to make for a good adaptation. I would love a tv show, with every year being a random important year, with political intrigue and behind the scenes of the hunger games. We can get different aspects of the districts as well while focusing on what makes the hunger games interesting. Which, to me, is the human nature element to it rather the romanticized elements these movies keeping giving us. 4.4/10 E'), ('0', ""It would've been better if they brought back district 8 hospital helper thats why this movie stunk""), ('4', ""Don't be like your father!

The teen superhero in an adult body is entertaining throughout. Instead of the dour, stoic heroes we know and love, these guys make jokes at their enemy’s expense. Perhaps a little too immature, but refreshingly human. The performances, though, cannot erase the stink of corporate interference. The pace of the movie is slowed down with each special effects shot. Too bad we’ve seen it all before. Gods on earth? Check. Seen in the Thor movies. Warping reality? Check. Seen it Dr. Strange movies. Dragons? Check. Seen it all over. Throw in a very blatant product placement and this movie is just another film ruined by notes from the studio. The movie’s pacing is all over the place. These characters have super speed and can fly. So why do we have to wait so long for them to appear on screen? Oh, you wanted to spend 10 minutes showing us the destruction of the city and the deaths of all those people. Here’s a novel idea for a super hero movie: have the hero’s save people. At one point, the big hero talks with his family for five minutes while innocent bystanders are being eaten by monsters. Another heart to heart goes one while the bad guy is politely waiting to restart the big fight. At other times, the heroes zip in and with this Macguffin or that. It all creates a feeling of stuff happening, and not any kind of story. The original Shazam worked so well because the film moved with the characters. This time around, the characters can hardly keep up at times and have to sit around waiting for their cue at other times. The movie also makes some odd choices for kids film. Characters casually throw around the “s” word and we see people effectively die. Yet the big fights are rather bloodless, often comical considering how invulnerable these characters are made out to be. Just commit to PG if you want an all ages crowd.

May December,2023-11-17,movie,117,85,7.0,"{('5', 'In moviemaking, there’s subtlety, and then there’s subtlety carried too far. In the case of director Todd Haynes’s latest, the filmmaker unfortunately indulges himself far too much in the latter. This story of an actress (Natalie Portman) who visits a middle-aged sex offender (Julianne Moore) to prepare for a role she’s about to play in a movie about her subject’s life never seems to find a footing to stick with and explore. The narrative examines many different aspects of the back story behind the lives of the characters to be portrayed in this pending production without ever really resolving any of them by the time the credits roll. This includes not only the protagonist’s reasons for pursuing her once-underage husband (Charles Melton) – actions that got her jailed and made her fodder for countless tawdry tabloid cover stories – but also the nature of the actress’s real motivations in conducting such an excessively intense in-depth study of her character. In the process, virtually everyone comes across as somewhat unsavory, and, considering that the truth is never clearly revealed about any of them, it begs the question, why should we care about any of this? The film depicts all of this so subtly that it goes beyond nuance, veering into the realm of enigmatic, thereby further reinforcing the notion of why any of us should care. Ironically, these underplayed elements are in stark contrast to some rather obvious (and terribly trite) symbolism, particularly in images related to themes of transition and transformation. The picture’s inconsistent changes in tone don’t help, either, vacillating between allegedly serious drama and a seemingly underdeveloped desire to break out as an exercise in full-fledged camp (which, by the way, probably would have made this a much better offering). The script’s meandering flow and glacial pacing also don’t help, leaving viewers scratching their heads more often than not as to where this story is headed. In the end, all of the foregoing is ultimately quite unfortunate, because there’s definite potential in this project, but it’s never adequately defined and fleshed out. Leads Moore and (especially) Portman turn in admirable efforts to make this material fly, but they simply don’t have enough to work with to make that happen. While there appear to be allusions to themes like the difficulty involved in dealing with long-buried feelings and the fact that we may never be able to adequately grasp the truth behind them (either as outsiders looking in or as active participants in the midst of such dealings), the cryptic handling of those ideas undermines whatever meaningful messages or cinematic value they might have, making all of this seem like just such a big waste of time. Director Haynes has an impressive filmography behind him with such releases as “Poison” (1991), “Far From Heaven” (2002) and “Dark Waters” (2019), but, regrettably, “May December” certainly can’t be counted as part of that list.'), ('8', 'Watch a family unravel when Natalie Portmans character enters their lives and brings out many disturbing truths as she ""method acts"" learning about Julianne Moore\'s controlling ""mother"" character who made tabloid headlines back in the 90\'s by having an affair with a 13 year old boy.

Director Todd Haynes has created an uncomfortable mix of situations that examine dysfunctional relationships and set up unfulfilled expectations. The scenes sometime approach depth, but often stop before any revelations.

THINGS I LIKED: I attended a press screener at a theater for a different movie where the trailer for Renfield showed. The audience was fairly quiet at the beginning, but as soon as Nicolas Cage appeared on the big screen, the entire audience burst out in delighted laughter. Without his over-the-top, ridiculous performance, this movie wouldn’t be nearly as entertaining as it is. He said that playing Dracula was a lifelong dream of his. He played a vampire in one of his earlier movies back in the 1980s, Vampire’s Kiss, so I guess you could say that this kind of role is in his BLOOD. ha ha The entertaining cast also includes Nicholas Hoult, Awkwafina, Ben Schwartz, Adrian Martinez, Brandon Scott Jones, Miles Doleac, and Shohreh Aghdashloo. They all do an excellent job. I wonder if it got confusing on filming days to have two leading men named Nicolas (Cage and Hoult). If nothing else, it’s a new take on the old story of Dracula. Director Chris McKay explained that he wanted this movie to be a sequel to Tod Browning’s Dracula in 1931! The marketing was supposed to reflect that connection, but it didn’t actually work. The castle seen in the movie is the same one used in the family-friendly movie Chitty-Chitty Bang Bang! It’s called Neuschwanstein, located in Bavaria, Germany. Guess what? Nicholas Cage actually owns a few castles in real life! It’s a pulp version of vampires with a lot of dark humor and comedic schtick. It’s also extremely campy, so be prepared. Shout-out to Wiccan Tumblr. Ha ha The themes and life lessons are simple and powerful. THINGS I DIDN’T LIKE: The film is extremely violent and gory. There are quite a few dark scenes at night that will make viewing difficult when watched on a small streaming device. The ending is vague enough that it leaves a crack open for a sequel.

Director Kelly Fremon Craig, who shows great sensitivity for making coming-of-age films (she was also in charge of 'The Edge of Seventeen'), adapts the novel of the same name and injects it with a notable dose of humanity and humanism. Margaret's conflict, uneasy about not knowing if she is Jewish or Catholic, alludes to the spiritual search many of us have undertaken at some point in our lives. Fremon Craig gets it right in showing how religion can bring out the best and worst in us. And that's not all, since the religious theme is complemented with a series of hilarious and tender situations typical of the subgenre, which contribute to the emotional burden that the protagonist carries, allowing many women to identify with her.

From what I saw neither steals the other's limelight, but clearly McAdams is the pro here and it's one of the best achievements of this film. As for the coming of age narrative, there's not much to explore that feels different from so many other films in the genre, but this time around director Kelly Fremon Craig succeeds in making it feel more organic and realistic than what she did in The Edge of Seventeen and considering it's her second film on the subject she evidently learned and made a better film.

''So it's my gardener''. ''He's valuable to me''. ''So it's my gardener''. Fair Play is an allegory about the dynamics of power embedded in a context of excessive wealth and ambition. It is about a ruthless capitalist world that mercilessly crushes anyone too weak to stand up to it. Telling a romantic story between two people involved in that world and working in the same hedge fund implies dealing with more than just ordinary moments of love. From the trailer, it can be anticipated that one of the central points of this plot lies in how business corrupts the lives of the main characters and how those around them, especially the female protagonist, consider others as mere disposable objects. Hence the quote I chose. The resulting dynamic between the two immediately generates feelings of resentment when she is promoted, and he is not. One begins to fall behind, and in this context, the plot development, although predictable due to the fact that it is rare for a man to tolerate his partner surpassing his work and economic achievements, whether for reasons of ego or self-esteem, suggests that the relationship has become a ticking time bomb, we just have to wait for the explosion.

The picture might be more worth watching if the two protagonists (Phoebe Dynevor, Alden Ehrenreich) weren’t so inherently deplorable and portrayed with some of the hammiest on-screen acting I’ve seen in a long time.

In the brief moments that the film deigns to have an overt plot, it postures as a rumination on grief and the acceptance of inevitable finality. The performances suffered at turns from the worst deficits of nuance or warmth and the grossest excesses of shonenesque overacting, no relationships were meaningful, no characters had arcs that felt earned or organic. Every action and world happened in service of getting to an ending so abrupt and bereft of weight that one would be forgiven assuming that it was an intermission in the seconds between the fade out and the amateurish white Comic Sans credits against an insipid blue background. That design, whether conscious or not, is a reasonable approximation of the film as a whole: painfully color backgrounds existing only to demarcate the borders of narrow, infrequent negative space; specifically narrative, emotion, and growth rather than just letters. Aesthetically and kinetically there are things to enjoy, even celebrate on the rare occasion, but on the whole, if it be the last of his work, it's a swan song unbefitting of its author, an seeming expression of disenchantment with the very ideas of thematic meaning and growth from someone in the uttermost sunset of their days.

The Boy and the Heron feels more like a self indulgent love letter to his filmography, and does not function well alone as a stand alone movie to the casual viewer. The film is autobiographical in nature and without previous knowledge of Miyazaki’s personal life or his previous works you will struggle to follow along. This is attempted to be masked and keep you engaged by the fantastical nature of the worlds you visit and quality of the animation of the film in general, but is not quite pulled off effectively. The films audience is much too niche. It was written for Miyazaki, and fans of Miyazaki himself, moreso than film fans in general, or meant to entertain or convey an important message.

The message should be clearly presented in the time, and should push the viewer to want to do some research on their own time to encourage a rewatch at a later time if pulled off correctly. This does not accomplish that.'), ('8', ""Another beautiful piece of art by Hiyao Miyazaki, though not perfect and certainly not the best movie he's done, it is deffinitely a worthy addition to his filmography. Worth watching on the big screen.""), ('10', 'Miyazaki\'s most complex film is also the most personal and symbolic one. The complexity of the plot of this work has left many people with doubts, Hayao Miyazaki himself leaves a message written on the great golden gate of the magical world: ""Whoever only seeks to understand, will perish."" Thus warning the viewer who wants all the answers in a first viewing, that it is not necessary to understand everything to enjoy the trip. Before watching the movie, you should know that it is his most abstract and metaphorical work... And that, of course, may be liked more or less, depending on the type of spectator you are, but there is nothing negative about it. Especially since we are talking about a case in which this abstraction is very well executed and in the most personal way. We are not talking about it being an especially surreal film in the style of David Lynch\'s cinema, since the most basic aspects of its plot can be understood and continued without problems from its first viewing. But the complexity is everything behind it, the similarities with the author\'s life, the great final metaphor with Miyazaki\'s current situation and the Studio Ghibli itself and all the symbols that the work hides in a masterfully way. In a time where all the great animated productions look for generic scripts, leaving no loose doubt at the end and everything closed (that\'s actually not something negative but in fact more commercial, since in the end those are works that with a single viewing you can forget, because there is not much else to excavate)... Miyazaki has clearly sought to create conversation, with a work that can be understood on the surface after only a viewing but that inevitably seeks to give something to talk about after finishing it, and even see it again. But although there are doubts as in every good Ghibli film, this work has hidden answers, many of them are deciphered with some context about the author\'s life or knowledge about the moments he symbolizes, but for others it is enough with a second viewing to fill every gap. Its symbols and references to cultural works as important as Dante Alighieri\'s ""Divine Comedy"" or its great similes with the director\'s childhood and life, reflect that in this film Miyazaki has wanted us to notice his author\'s stamp more than ever, therefore, he is much more personal than any of his previous ones. Even though, we will talk about a plot that, although complex, is simple in the superficial, and at the same time, surprisingly one of the most cohesive of the director once you understand the nuances. The film has a great execution of its rhythm, which begins as a slow walk, more realistic and mature, cooking the plot on low heat while showing us mistakes, gestures or simple scenes of how a character changes clothes that any conventional film would have suppressed, but that Miyazaki (as he really does in all his previous films), decides to show those to us for giving animated realism to his characters, who also err in their daily actions. But little by little in that realism a fantasy is dripping that threatens the viewer, and is getting closer and closer, and when it arrives, it floods the screen. And that\'s when the rhythm leaves that realism a little more aside to immerse ourselves in an agile rhythm adventure that takes us through endless places that overflow imagination. And we could also talk about his curious characters, many quite memorable and who will undoubtedly go down in history as some of the most charismatic of the studio\'s films, such as the heron itself or the parakeets. And others that follow the writing style of the director\'s characters: such as the Parakeet King, a subtle villain who ends up crumbling or Kiriko, the already classic representation of a strong and capable woman from Miyazaki\'s cinema. Without going into spoilers, little more can I say, beyond the fact that visually the film is a technical portent that will artistically dazzle anyone. The quality of its animations is masterful and the film is a great poem that reminds us that traditional animation, or simply 2D, still has a lot to offer, and that 3D CGI does not replace it, nor is it the future, since it is just one more technique.'), ('5', 'Some cool surrealism parts,but overall a disappointing story.

It's an original, fascinating concept that gets into Ken Russell tripiness at times, but is a wild ride.""), ('5', 'Alexander Skarsgård is one of the more courageous actors working today. He’s been willing to portray unappealing characters and to take big risks with the roles he’s played. Recently, he’s been an abusive husband in TV’s “Big Little Lies,” an amoral tech CEO (I know, redundant, right?) on “Succession” and a Viking prince with anger management issues in the film “The Northman.” His role here may be his most challenging to date. In Writer/Director Brandon Cronenberg’s “Infinity Pool,” James (Skarsgård) and his wife are vacationing at La Tolqa, a fictional beachfront resort. After publishing a single, poorly-received book six years ago, James is seeking inspiration. The couple encounters Gabi (Mia Goth) and Alban, who invite them on a trip outside the compound, even though it’s strictly forbidden. Driving back drunk, James hits and kills a local resident. He’s arrested and taken by the police to a sober, concrete, Soviet-style police station where he’s presented with a choice. He can be executed for his capital crime. Or, for a hefty fee, he can be cloned and have his double die in his place. After that, the movie gets weird. As with his first film “Possessor,” Cronenberg demonstrates his skill as a provocateur. The opening visual, where the camera rotates 360 degrees, informs us early that what’s to come will be disorienting. People wear grotesque masks. They engage in orgies, although they’re more psychedelic than explicit. This is a film that’s disturbing, bewildering, upsetting and disgusting but also thought-provoking. What works here is the acting. Skarsgård shows his versatility as James (and one or two of his clones). After starring in this year’s “Pearl” and “X,” Mia Goth uses this project to solidify her status as the latest scream queen. She’s particularly skillful at compellingly portraying unhinged maniacs. What doesn’t occur is adequate development of the many themes Cronenberg addresses in the film. He clearly disdains the entitlement of rich Western travelers who inflict themselves on some of the world’s poorest but most beautiful countries. But his critique of privilege is neither as well-focused nor as insightful as what we’ve already seen in “Parasite,” “The Menu” or even “Glass Onion.” He swings and misses when given the opportunity to address the nature of humanness in the context of clones. Where he connects most powerfully is when he proposes that humans will sink to their worst instincts and impulses when placed in a world where their actions have no consequences. In 1996’s “Crash,” Writer/Director David Cronenberg, Brandon’s father, explored a subculture of people physically disfigured in car crashes. In “Infinity Pool,” Brandon Cronenberg is clearly interested in exploring a less obvious disfigurement: events that warp the psyche and damage if not obliterate the soul.'), ('9', ""With a personal hallmark, although identical to his father's, Brandon Cronenberg presents a rather bizarre fable about the cynicism and immorality of wealthy people.

As the story unfolds, we witness a couple, James and Em Foster, getting swept up in a maelstrom of body horror, twisted power dynamics, and surreal imagery that threatens to consume them entirely.

I wish we'd known more about the sci-fi concept of the film — the doppelgangers — because it's very intriguing. Unfortunately, Brandon Cronenberg's screenplay gets messier as the story goes by, and the plot gets tedious by the second part. Some thoughts are very in-your-face, and the graphic images are there only for shock value most of the time. But hey, at least the trippy sequences are cool; they reminded me of the Panos Cosmatos 'Cabinet of Curiosities' episode. Also, the upper-class critique theme is oversaturated by now. We've had no shortage of these films or series in the last couple of years, and lots of them have been notably superficial. 'Infinity Pool' offers a no conventional take on the subject — although the representation of the locals as bloodthirsty individuals in rags is up to debate — but it gets underdeveloped when the writer/director starts to follow another thread, which is another problem the movie has; many ideas feel undercooked.

However, one look at the average user score will tell you otherwise. The heart of this story has always been its wonderful characters. Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsay deliver award-worthy performances as Joel and Ellie respectively. The whole story revolves around these two characters as they face the internal and external challenges of the new world. Guest stars Nick Offerman and Murray Bartlett as survivalist couple Frank and Bill give us one of television's best single-episode stories in the third episode of this season. Along with these two, Lamar Johnson and Keivonn Woodard also give Emmy-nominated guest performances as the brother duo of Henry and Sam, on the run from a dangerous group that Henry has wronged. It is in these human stories that The Last of Us is at its best. While the zombie action is a bit sparse, there are a number of high-stakes, gun blazing moments in the first season.

But the worst of it is the season finale. It could\'ve been a good ending, possibly great. Ellie might have been presented with the hard choice of sacrificing herself in order to maybe save the human race. I mean, she spent most of the first season risking her life to maybe save the human race, but in the end the people creating the show made the deliberate choice to give us the triumph of selfishness over heroism. They turned Ellie into a victim and made Joel appear like a monster who kills half the people trying to save the human race. Oh, you might say, but Joel was trying to save Ellie. Sure, he probably saw it that way. But the problem is we the audience don\'t really know what\'s happening because we weren\'t shown what happened to Ellie while Joel was unconscious. Was she offered a choice? Was she treated like a lab rat with no rights? The most important plot point in the show and we\'ll never know the answer because the show runners either lacked the nerve to put it on screen or don\'t know the difference between good and evil. And based on what I saw on the screen the story ends with the human race doomed thanks in part to one man\'s evil. There are other problems, too. Like the flashlight batteries still holding a charge 20 years after. Like the ""survivalist"" relying on gasoline and diesel fuel long after either would have degraded into garbage. Like the dam still supplying some people with electricity, because, you know, Jesus descended from the Heavens to ensure that the people with the technical background to keep a hydroelectric station running would still be on the job. Like the zombies. Not because it\'s fungus turning people into zombies. Because I read about fungus and bugs years ago so matching the fungus with people isn\'t that big of a leap. The problem here is that the zombies, on the rare occasions when we see them, look like something out of a Troma release. It doesn\'t matter if you start the film with scientists explaining that fungus zombies are a real possibility if the zombies you put on-screen look like some no-budget 1950s movie monster. I give the series a 5 because it\'s watchable, and, frankly, the show runners deserve some cred for episode three, which is probably the best episode of all. Apologies to all the juvenile minds that just can\'t handle a little relationship diversity. Try growing up.'), ('9', ""Less action, same emotion. The track record of adapting video games into live-action hasn't been very favorable, but recently, this bad reputation is changing.

However, many people haven't experienced them, and this is a new opportunity for those who don't play video games. The series was created by the game's own creator, Neil Druckmann, which ends up saving it from becoming just another failure among many other video game adaptations. What was adapted fits well into a more realistic live-action series, abandoning the action parts but keeping all the important elements for the story being told, which is the same as in the game. I would say it's an adaptation with little adaptation since it's very faithful to the game, featuring scenes exactly like those in the game. Since the game is incredible, the series is good too.

Poker Face (2023),2023-01-26,tvshow,2,84,6.5,"{('5', ""The first two episodes are engaging and fun, with great cinematography. The show becomes increasingly formulaic with less mystery and less believability in each new episode. I'd say it's a 7 for the first 2 episodes, trending towards a 4 later in the season. I stopped watching at ep 7.""), ('8', '(Ep 1 ""Dead Man\'s Hand"" + Ep 2 ""The Night Shift"") A waitress named Charlie with a gift for detecting deception gets recruited by a casino boss to exploit a high-roller\'s poker game, while she deals with her friend\'s violent murder. Charlie then hits the road, but finds herself poking around the apparent wrongful arrest of a helpful trucker she meets at a remote rest stop. Charlie is played by Natasha Lyonne as a Columbo-type sleuth who is also a self-described dumbass. Like Columbo she is usually an apologetic and unthreatening interrogator, but unlike Columbo you know that sometimes she is not just PLAYING dumb. She keeps stumbling into obstacles or solutions without knowing how or if she can master or learn from the experience. The nominal hook for the series is Charlie\'s seemingly infallible gift for smelling out intentionally deceptive utterances. That ability gets less focus in the initial episodes than one might expect, and is downplayed by Charlie herself as a source of frustration and confusion.I expect from Rian Johnston\'s past screenwriting that POKER FACE will eventually mine the premise for clever twists and payoffs. However, that isn’t strongly evident in the openering stories. They presumably have to focus more on establishing the character and the series\' plot arc. These lean engaging and clear mystery/crime storytelling that is still pretty conventional. If anything, POKER FACE is more distinguished by how Charlie\'s amateur investigator status lends dramatic weight to her personal confrontations with perpetrators. This show is a great vehicle for Natasha Lyonne\'s anti-glamorous screen persona as a bed-headed working-class day-drinker. She gets the best moments in the episodes viewed: an excited off-screen reaction to a luxurious private chamber; and a charming delivery of the line, ""I\'m gonna... accept this situation."": her bemused reaction to waking up somewhere unexpected. A low-expectations attitude to her abilities and to looming threats make her an exception to the variously committed and well-resourced law-enforcement and P.I. types who populate crime shows. It makes it harder for writers to insert high stakes into her stories, but it does make her more relatable. By default she wants to ignore people\'s lies and manipulations and avoid involvement, but she is torn by the impulse to keep poking her nose where it is not welcome because something just doesn\'t feel right. Rather than being a crime buster straight out of the gate, she is going to have to learn as she goes without much support. You could say that Charlie is the detective character updated for the current generation living in the casual-employment/gig-work/side-hustle economy. Outside of the likeable lead, most of the other elements of the series are pretty solid, if occasionally requiring some commitment from the viewer . The hour-plus run times that streaming makes possible enabled lots of setup for ongoing character arcs in episode one but also was used to lay out multiple additional characters in the new setting Charlie arrives at while on the road in episode two. Hopefully the episode scripts get a bit tighter as the series progresses. The first two episodes use a version of the crime solving narrative format used in Columbo and Law and Order: Criminal Intent. That is, we are shown up front the events of the crime, and the question to be resolved is not whodunnit but how close will they get to getting away with it before the investigator gets involved and then catches them out. The specific non-linear narrative structure used here - in which the action starts with the crime then the timeline flashes back to before Charlie crosses paths with those events - could quickly get old if repeated consistently. (Unless, perhaps, the writers play around with some variations of it.) The show’s production has a retro feel, utilising seventies/eighties era colours and fonts for the credits, and a tendency to lean on in-camera or otherwise low-tech methods to add expressive visuals. For example, a youth’s alienation is flagged by shooting his point of view watching a flirting couple through the smudged pane of a frosted refrigerator door in a store. The success of the show will depend on how well it combines an ongoing arc for Charlie with standalone crime of the week stories. There is apparently a packed cast of name actors slated for future episodes. John Ratzenberger in episode two provides a solid but non-showy performance in a supporting role, while the casino boss in ep one gave Adrian Brody a chance to deliver a dense backstory in the enjoyable form of a rhythmically flowing yarn. So, the uses the guest cast are put to will probably vary. The mildly taxing screen time demands of setting up a new scenario in each episode lost them half a star. Otherwise episodes went down easy, combining humour and dramatic tension in clear and enjoyable ways. This is almost certainly a worthwhile series to follow.'), ('6', 'Quirky show. Lead actress takes some getting used to, but ok. Plots are kind of thin sometimes but ok other times. A Columbo structure (we know who did it up front) while she solves the crime. Kind of stupid that she puts herself in danger each show and escapes with great luck. We\'d rate it ""give it a try and you may like it.""'), ('9', ""Outstanding show so far.

I’ve been a diehard Frasier fan for most of my life and frankly the idea for this series is perfect. My mom passed away last month, this was our favorite show together growing up. I got her the Blu-ray’s last year for Christmas, we watched it together before she got diagnosed with lung cancer. I remember her saying her only issue with Frasier is how could he stand at not living closer to Freddy? I genuinely feel like people need to chill out and give season one a chance to breathe. I can already tell it’s gonna be a solid season. As someone else pointed out on here, season one of the Office US did not review well, their trying to find their footing right now, and I want to see them find it to, grateful for a few more seasons with such a loved character like Frasier.'), ('10', ""It's really beautiful and warm to see Frasier again, a really adorable and fun character.

The other characters are spot on--love them. This show has so much promise--so lets get to it!! Give us your best (writers, directors etc) so they can give us their best.

I was sad the Niles and Daphne didn't have any cameo at all, and their son is by far the most under developed character as he's in the least amount of scenes, and they play him as a caricature of his parents since their missing. Still, I'm grateful the show is on the air, gives me something very different to watch these days. Keep in mind one the top shows today is literally about naked people on an island dating lol I miss this more wholesome stuff, plus watched it with my dad, big Frasier fan himself, and he was like it was okay, not bad, just okay and he told me he was just glad to see Kelsey Grammer back doing such a beloved character again, I'll make sure to come back and update this by the end of this first season, here's hoping it just gets better and better from here!""), ('10', ""I don't normally leave reviews here, but I saw the absolutely ludicrous critic scores and actually got a little offended by how their talking about Kelsey Grammer and this new show.

As for the show itself, I can confidently say that by the end of episode 2 I was really charmed by it all. I felt like enough time had passed that Frasier felt like a character coming back to, I love how their is this whole missing chapter in his life getting teased out in discovery dialog, and visually as he buys something most us wouldn't even be able to afford to rent. I won't go on too long here, I just wanted to say, in my humble opinion, this isn't trying to be True Crime Season 4 here; this is a family-friendly sitcom filmed in front of a live audience like a little play put on once a week, it's cute and very fun, and I feel like the critics come off like a bunch of boring jaded monsters who've forgotten how to enjoy simple things. Reminds me honestly of the critic in Pixar's Ratatouille. Lastly, I will just add that Kelsey Grammer has since the first run of Frasier, become pretty loud about his political leanings, you do have to wonder when you see almost all the negative reviews seem to be coming from the most far-left publications. It's not a good look. Just go watch it for yourself!""), ('0', ""Horribly written. 1 joke in the first 10 minutes. Don't waste your time.

The cringe factor seems to be more about protest over it not literally being cast as a direct sequel to season 11 of Frasier. Frankly I’ve watched those 11 seasons to death. I welcome new characters interacting with Frasier, and as much as I miss Martin Crane, not much we can do about that now. I do appreciate them trying to mirror what made the last series so successful. A father and son trying to build a life were they valued being close to each other.

Two more minutes after that and the blatantly obvious badly-written jokes (as in from a really bad 90s sitcom ""Saved by the bell-esque"" style) kick in altogether with some unnecessary 90s slapstick moves. It is so bad that it is impossible to believe this was made in 2023. That bad. Period. Totally unnecessary reboot. Just go and rewatch the original series; time well spent. You\'ll thank me later.'), ('8', ""I got a chance to watch this as I was getting ready for work this morning and frankly, I enjoyed it. The original Frasier is one of my all-time favorite shows, so it is nice to see a return to form for Kelsey Grammar. He plays his role perfectly, while the rest of the cast compliments him nicely. I especially enjoyed David, Niles and Daphne's son, as he is a nice fill-in for David Hyde Pierce' absence. I could see this getting significantly better as it goes on.""), ('8', 'Like a comfortable blanket, this warms my heart.

Some things never change, but in otherways, his focus is different., I also appreciate as someone who rebelled hard against one of my parents as well, Freddy feels like a logical outcome as Frasier, though loving, has always been self-absorbed and obsessed with outward things. I like the new cast, it's fun seeing how Frasier fits into their lives and vice versa, it's a solid beginning to something new, the only character I struggled with was his Nephew feels a little out of place, but I'm open to it, and it seems like a fun actor playing the role. Genuinely excited for the rest of season 1!""), ('10', ""Let's be very clear here: a lot of vitriol around this reboot falls into one of two categories; people too love Drunk on the Last series, angry it's not season 12 of Frasier, with the entire original cast, a lot of that died with John Mahoney. Next is legacy media, furious about the man behind the character, Kelsey Grammer, a very loud conservative in a far-left industry. They are chomping at the bit to destroy this man. They can't handle him having any more success than he already did. (Literally, all the worst reviews read like a list of the top media giants in the country, as if they are all repeating a scripted response). Look, it's a fresh series with James Burrows in the Director's Chair, the co-creator of Cheers and The Mary Tyler Moore Show, it will continue to get better and better the more room it gets to breath, and I have high confidence it will land well by the end of season 1 with most people, and season 2 like all good sitcoms will be in part based on the feedback of season 1. Remember this, Season 1 of the Office barely managed a higher score then this and still to this day sits at a 66.

It's a silly world we live in, now go enjoy some Frasier and decide for yourself! :)""), ('9', 'I mean we got a new season of Frasier, it’s good, I’m holding out until I see all ten episodes, might come back and change this score later if it really bombs in my opinion, but otherwise it’s exactly what the trailers showed us. Not sure what people were expecting I think I had my expectations better reigned in to be fair.'), ('9', 'This is Frasier. It\'s a simple family comedy with a laugh track. Critics seem to have written it off, but it\'s not Frasier that changed, it\'s them. The first 10 minutes of the show were unbelievably awkward, and my guess is many critics stopped watching there and started complaining. The internet has really ruined simple, straightforward family comedy in the last five years. People don\'t watch TV anymore to watch it. They watch to complain about it online. This is pretty much Frasier at his best with a surrounding cast that can\'t keep up. And that\'s exactly what the original Frasier was, too. Ross was never as funny as people remember. Neither was Niles. Neither was his dad (although he was close). The premise of the original Frasier was ""This is Kelsey Grammar out-comedying everyone around him with one-liners to their situations."" It\'s the same thing here. Don\'t listen to critics. Watch this show. It\'s worth it just to see Kelsey Grammar be brilliant one more time.'), ('10', 'The original show is my favourite show of all time, and I regard it as one of the best comedies ever written—as do many. So naturally, I was both excited and terrified when I heard it was coming back. Now that it\'s here, and I\'ve had a chance to see the first two episodes, I\'m optimistic. It\'s the same in some ways, different in others, and I get the impression that a tad more thought and care has gone into it than is the norm these days. I can appreciate that, at the very least. Kelsey is great, but the guy played Frasier for twenty years, then spent the next twenty years doing impressions of him for every second fan he met. So yeah, he gets it, he could portray the character whilst in a coma, enough said; there was never a chance he\'d be what let the show down. The rest of the characters are all competently acted even if conservatively conceived. Clearly the intention is to replicate the main archetypes from the original show. As I said, that\'s a very conservative choice, but okay, I can roll with it. I don\'t particularly care if an idea is original, just that it\'s well executed. Over the first two episodes, it\'s impossible to call, but there\'s a decent foundation that can be built upon. The writing is solid, but you can tell it\'s been written in a different day and age. There are some definitive ""old-school"" Frasier moments that conjure up or lean more on nostalgia, as well as more contemporary touches that would feel right at home in any other modern sitcom, but that will stand out to fans of the original. The latter aren\'t bad, just different, more mainstream. Given time, this new melding of tone could end up being the originality that the fundamental ideas lack. Plot-wise I must admit, the stories from both episodes hit me in the feels. This might be where my objectivity fades and I ""fanboy out"" a bit. You have been warned. Freddy relating to his grandfather\'s death on another level in episode one struck a chord. A touch contrived, maybe, but the weight of John Mahoney\'s impeccable portrayal of Martin hung over that whole scene so it was earned nonetheless. We can only imagine how proud Martin was of his firefighting grandson, so it fits. The flag from Martin\'s casket helping to build the bridge between Frasier and Freddy was amazing (my wife was in tears). The father and son in this episode aren\'t as estranged as Martin and Frasier were—nor would it make sense if they were—they just needed a dash of common sense. Martin was always full of that. The second episode was even more impressive than the first, culminating in the most satisfying Darth Vader parody I\'ve ever seen. Frasier contriving the ridiculous story of Freddy\'s lineage to help his son save face in front of his friends was such a Frasier thing to do. How many times have fans seen Frasier relentlessly pursue something out of pure selfishness, only to turn his attention to a person more in need because of his good nature (i.e. ""The 1,000th Show"", ""Death Becomes Him""). He could have rubbed it in more, or taken the moment entirely for himself, but that\'s not the Frasier we know and love. When push comes to shove, Frasier won\'t throw anyone under the bus whatever the cost to him personally. The fact that the writers and show-runners seem to know that, gives me hope… just maybe, they all get it, and will do the show justice. I\'m giving it a 10, not because it was perfect, but because nothing about it detracted from my experience so much that I was anything other than overjoyed about having more Frasier to watch. And that\'s the point, ultimately… it feels like I\'m watching a continuation of something worthwhile, and no reboot of a TV show I\'ve seen before now has ever felt that way. Reboots of this caliber should be the norm and are instead the exception, which is very saddening.'), ('1', 'As a fan of the original series, I had high hopes for the reboot. Unfortunately, the most obvious contrast is how the show slips from an extremely talented supporting cast and complex characters in the original, to an underwhelming supporting cast and poorly thought-out and developed characters in the current incarnation.'), ('10', ""Dude, what are those critics smoking? It's literally more of Kelsey Grammer playing Frasier, except now it's twenty years later, he got Bibi Blazer's dream famous, walked away, and realized he failed Freddy. Literally, the perfect place to pick up almost 20 years later; keep this in mind, David Hyde Pierce killed any chance of the revival they're complaining about; he decided for everyone else that if John Mahoney wasn't there, there was no point. This killed momentum on a lot of the original cast returning. Honestly, it's better for it; it's forced the writers to get more creative. Such a better show then some of these shills are making it out to be, it's the return of the King of Sitcoms, and their over there acting like it's dead on arrival because it's not Sex in the City; what a bunch of dumb takes."")}","{(7.8, 'The show totally works.

So why not be evil and gain the benefits if there is no accounting, no damnation? And if a supernatural soul is out, what explains the supernatural personification of death?

I didn\'t really feel very connected to the main protagonist or his companions by the end. There certainly isn\'t too much depth to the characters.

This is unfortunate since they\'re some of the strongest actors in the cast. Quan talks a bit about the broken system of Hollywood for Chinese Americans, and it\'s one of the few conversations about race that actually land within the series; not focusing on some strawman racist, but a real, lived experience within the business and culture of Hollywood. Outside of this you\'re left with a mediocre but enjoyable fantasy story, with a bit of coming-of-age drama. It\'s fun and the fight scenes are well choreographed. I did feel drawn to watch the next episode when one finished, just to see how the story turned out. This will definitely be more popular in a younger audience. If you\'re an adult you will find a few parts preachy and annoying, but the underlying story of a fantasy world, building self-confidence, strong relationships, and dealing with home issues is well enough done for a single watch.

The second series in June was crushed by the critics\' evaluations. If in the case of ""The Idol"" low marks were given by both the press and the audience, in the case of ""Crowded Room"" only film critics were dissatisfied.

Danny and Ariana decide to attack one person. According to their plan, Danny was supposed to kill this man, but he does not dare to do so. Ariana takes his gun away from him and starts shooting, without aiming very hard, and hits him in the shoulder. Soon the police arrive and Danny is able to escape, but in the evening he is arrested on charges of shooting at Rockefeller Centre. Further plot development will be relayed through the main character\'s flashbacks during interrogations with a psychologist named Raya Goodwin, which reminded me of the narrative system from Mafia: The City of Lost Heaven (also known as Mafia: Definitive Edition). Each episode of this series keeps the viewer in suspense, immersing them in Danny\'s story. The plot of the series is full of plot twists and turns, intriguing the viewer. Near the end of the third series, after learning more about the reasons for their actions, I developed sympathy for the main character. In this series, Tom Holland has demonstrated his outstanding acting skills to date. He has shown that he can successfully handle playing blockbusters like the Marvel films as well as serious and multifaceted roles like in this series. I also hope that this is not Tom\'s last challenging and interesting role, and that we will see him with a well-deserved Oscar in his hands in the future. The costumes in the series are very good, in addition to being appropriate to the time period of the series (late 70\'s), they also better reveal the characters and show their essence. In general, the series ""Crowded Room"" is a noteworthy work. It has an exciting plot, high quality acting and skilful embodiment of characters.

Though the last 15 minutes of the finale were actually enjoyable because of some characters from the original series showing up. As for this one, most of the characters were not just not interesting, but annoyingly stupid and not worth watching. Timothy Olyphant still did a great job playing Raylan Givens, but the storyline didn't set him up for success and he seemed a complete misfit in an otherwise terrible show. Many of the actions he took, or didn't take, were not true to his original character. It was a cool touch to see his real life daughter play his daughter in the show, but from a story perspective it was rather irrelevant. And while Boyd Holbrook is a very good actor and it's fun to see him in many roles, the main villain character was not intelligent and so wasn't justice to Holbrook either. I'd say the same for many of the other good actors in the show who unfortunately had to play very weak characters. The witty dialogue, richness of the characters and good storylines that made the original Justified so awesome were all missing in this reboot. Even though the last 15 minutes of the finale hint that there could be another season, I hope that it is developed by the screenwriters as a continuation on the basis of the original Raylan Givens books and the original Justified series. After all if they could write a character like Boyd Crowder so well for 6 seasons, even though he was only supposed to be in the original pilot, then there is no reason they can't expand the original series.

I don\'t understand the need for this apology as the original Raylan was portrayed as honorable, but also morally grey and often problematic. Raylan\'s romance with the sketchy judge was incredibly awkward.

But, there was another actor, Olivia Scott Welch (as the daughter), which I just had to check out to see if she was going to be able to produce like I thought she might have the talent to reach... and she is probably going to get there in the first season.

Perhaps the producers had budget targets that had to be met until it was clearer if the series was going to be good enough for additional investment.

The old man is an admitted rapist, a majority of ambiguous incestuous relationships to breed specific traits in humans, and there is a woman whom wants to live in a globalist dictatorship. These plots are very offputting and there was never a condemnation of such a thing, which leads me to believe that they condone this type of fascism.'), ('3', ""A mess.

If you’re set on watching this show, my advice: the minute an episode ends and you find yourself thinking, “Huh, that didn’t make me laugh even once”…just stop watching there. The sketches start off charming and funny enough (if a bit underwhelming) and get progressively less funny as the show goes on.

It was the actors and the performances. To me, Gene Wilder will always be synonymous with Mel Brooks. No one could pull off a Brooks role like him. And of course Madeline Kahn, Rudy De Luca, Harvey Korman, Cloris Leachman, Dom DeLuise and Marty Feldman. They were the perfect actors to make it work. And I think that's why this doesn't work. Part 1 was the epitome of Brooks. It had all the best lines and jokes. And all of his best actors in 1 place. Part 2 doesn't have those actors and it has none of the magic. They tried to take a formula that worked over 40 years ago and make it work now. At a time where too much has changed since. It doesn't translate. They've tried to force the Brooks formula into a new one and new actors. Actors who, while funny, don't fit the formula.

I\'d recommend to watch the movie before the show.--------- General Opinion: The show is fun, beautifully animated, heartwarming, and the music and sound design are on point. There are scenes that live rent-free in my memory like the first of \'Whatever\' or the fighting scene of \'Ramona rents a video\'. And some jokes make me chuckle when I randomly think about them, like: ""I am Scott"" and ""Emotional business, find me a witness"". ------------Characters: At first I was kind of disappointed because the show leaves on the bench characters that I love from the books. But we already got the story of those. So, after realizing what the show was doing, I was glad to see the anime focusing on others. Todd and Envy are a weird case. As they were well developed in the books, now they serve as support characters for Wallace. I wish they had something more going on. -----------Conclusion: I am divided in my opinion on the show. On the one hand, I feel like it misses the opportunity to gather a new audience as its metanarrative is highly dependent on the movie. On the other, I was hyped, surprised, and highly entertained. The changes on the anime were worth but I still prefer the books. I wonder if I would feel different if the marketing had been honest. ------------ One foot note I need to express: Bryan Lee O\'Malley shows his personal struggles in Scott Pilgrim, leaving gaps for you to fill with your own. Hence, as a teenager, the books showed me how to grow up from my painful experiences. And as an adult, the show gave me the courage to finally talk to my girlfriend about a problem we have been sitting on for almost a year.'), ('2', 'Why it\'s called ""Scott Pilgrim"" if the show is not about him?

(And a great game too!) Thirteen years and one divorcé later, both the comics and film have, my most measures, been critiqued more than any other piece of media this past decade. Culture critics alike have lampooned the series, notoriously Negative XP\'s song \'Scott Pilgrim vs. the World Ruined a Whole Generation of Women\' that pokes at the scene girls of that era. And while I may have some distain for this hyperbolic analysis, the comics and movie certainly aren\'t without their own flaws. While Scott might\'ve completed his hero\'s journey, having him win Ramona at the end didn\'t feel like the right ending to what was already very toxic relationship. Something was missing from this arc. When an animated series was announced, produced by Edgar Wright and Bryan Lee O\'Malley, animation by famous Japanese studio Science SARU... AND all the original cast back to voice their respected roles, there was much anticipated buzz about Scott Pilgrim being back in a public eye. But what would that look like? Scott Pilgrim Taking Off left me confused at first, pleasantly surprised later, and falling in love with every single one of these characters again. Between the meta-humor and callbacks, much of this series charm comes from that Episode 1 twist. I\'m glad that I wasn\'t spoiled and, while far from perfect, what we got was wonderful reunion that left me wanting more from this project. Without spoiling too much... Scott needed to be gone for a few episodes to address the flaws that I mentioned earlier. Giving Ramona her time to confront her ex’s allowed us to develop both them and her. Showing us that Bryan really cares about these characters. That they still live inside his head. He could’ve easily done a 1:1 adaptation, but the same hyperbolic criticisms of Ramona and Scott’s relationship would still exist. Just Garden State 2.0 Animated. We often forget that it was nothing short of a miracle that the movie by Edgar Wright even exists. If you prefer the movie over the animated series, more power to you. Just keep this one thing in mind... This series is way more than just about Scott Pilgrim. It\'s about a nerdy, neurodivergent kid from Canada who learned to have respect for himself. Who found love, got married, and later divorced. His story, however, isn\'t the the first and last of it\'s kind. Whoever the next Scott is... I hope to see you in Season 2. Even if it means waiting for a thousand years. ;-)'), ('4', 'The show is not really about Scott, he actually had a minor role in the show.

The story tries to go in an interesting direction, but combine that with the aforementioned shoddy pacing, weird character writing that teeters on parody for many characters (looking at you Gideon), and an entirely undeserved and head-scratching climax, Scott Pilgrim Takes Off is something that while I didn't hate, I don't see myself returning to anytime soon, glad that it is finding a home in the hearts of many though even if not me.""), ('8', 'It turned out to be a very pleasant surprise, which immediately went to the 2nd viewing.
