Beyonce's stamina and technical skills as a singer and dancer are beyond reproach and are fun to see. It's also refreshing to see an artist involved in every element of a show's production whereas she could surely pass a lot of duties to others. The sheer spectacle and fun of the concert comes to a grinding halt however during many of the documentary portions. Beyonce represents the American ethos of self-assured individualism about as well anyone in this film and it's hard to not feel that her approach to work sometimes veers into self-aggrandizement. It's wonderful to see the work of her many collaborators but did we also really need to see Beyonce overriding and belittling their advice? The implication in these sequences is that she is consistently combatting laziness, corner cutters and compromisers. She alone can do it. In the era of strongman politicians and megalomaniacal billionaires, is this really what we need to see? Beyonce addresses her take no guff attitude head one in at least one voiceover, saying it doesn't preclude empathy. Nice to hear but well it would been better to see, and maybe have the impression for at least a solitary moment that humility and accountability factored into the show and its music.""), ('10', ""LOVED IT!

They truly created a supermachine. It never stops to amaze me how she always comes up with new stuff and manages to top everything she has done before.

Seeing this with my Mom, who I went to see Beyoncé with as well, was so important. The message about being a mom and being there for your children was so beautiful and made me so thankful that I got to experience this whole thing with my Mom. The editing and soundscape for this film was on a whole new level. The constant cuts to different outfits, the loud bass, and the hundreds of different camera angles made it a whole different experience compared to the concert. It is obvious to me that Beyoncé is the greatest living entertainer of our time and that NO ONE is on her level. The fact that she was so involved in every single aspect of this tour and movie is so impressive.

Some of the actors really fell out of place especially when they were better picks for the casting in regards to the supporting rolls.

One of Christopher Nolan’s mid film I will say as a causal fan of Christopher Nolan (my favorite being interstellar) a 3 hour epic of the true story of Dr. Oppenheimer and the atomic bomb. If you’re into history this movie has enough there for you, but it does fall somewhat flat at what it’s trying to do and the structure of the story is clunky and convoluted, the worst part about the movie for me. If your a film buff like myself there’s something there for you but nothing too groundbreaking other than a special effects masterclass. I did find myself somewhat dissatisfied with what I was expecting but if you go in with an open mind and not too many expectations you should enjoy it.

How do I even begin to describe this movie. Why I missed it in the theaters is a mystery to me as well but man, Christopher Nolan is the single most greatest director of all time and I\'m not going to take that back. Going into this I was scared I would get bored but man from the first minute I was hooked all the way to the end. Cillian Murphy deserves an Oscar for his performance as Dr J Robert Oppenheimer. As well as Robert Downey Jr does an absolutely amazing performance as Lewis Strauss. The whole cast is absolutely amazing and the amount of detail put into this is crazy and the large ensemble is too great. Florence Pugh is one of the stars as well along with Emily Blunt. There are so much amazing things about this movie but what I love the most is the character development of Oppenheimer which is mind blowing followed by an incredible script by Nolan himself. The foreshadowing in this thing is crazy as well, the full circle moments are mind blowing as well. And of course the explosion itself doesn\'t disappoint at all, it\'s big, it\'s large and loud. Christopher Nolan is absolutely crazy for this and that\'s what makes me love him even more. The visuals as well are incredible and packed with that beautiful and suspenseful soundtrack by Ludwig Gorranson that I will listen on repeat from now. There are so much more things that I want to say that I can\'t describe in words, end of review, Christopher Nolan is 100% the greatest human being to ever make a film. Overall, after watching this I do need that JFK movie.

Not only was the editing horribly done and confusing, the message of the movie was highly politically biased and is basically propaganda. The movie was way too long and could have been 2 hours. And ofcourse it wouldn't be a Hollywood film if there were no misplaced sex scenes involved. The dropping of the bomb on Japan on none civilian targets was basically genocide and a war crime, but the movie didn't touch upon this subject. Also the movie fail to mention that Admiral Chester Nimitz who was in command of the pacific fleet campaign against Japan, wrote a petition to Harry S Truman personally not to use the bomb as the Japanese were about to surrender anyways. However Japan wanted to surrender to Russia under conditions. USA wanted Japan to surrender to USA unconditionally. The dropping of the bomb was therefore politically motivated and was not necessary. This is a failed opportunity of Nolan to clarify history and make this topic relevant that USA should never have built this bomb and use it and basically committed war crimes while doing so, but instead make it anti communist movie instead. The communist threat that never existed. Vietnam became a moderate country, and China is more capitalist than any western nations. The Soviet Russians became democratic and that worked out of them alot, NOT. Russia under a democracy became more military aggressive than during the Soviets communist era. Since democracies have conducted more wars the past few decades than communism, this checks out.""), ('10', ""Fantastic movie.

They took everything of interest about the making of the atomic bomb, including the devastating impacts on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and focussed instead on political intrigue which I couldn't care less about. Such a missed opportunity to make something genuinely thoughtful and moving about the horrors of nuclear weapons and a crisis of conscience. Also reminiscent of the 1980s in terms of its treatment of female characters, which are either crazy or long suffering. Very reductive.""), ('8', 'Loved it. One of Nolan’s best.Managed to make a 3 hour court drama compelling and keep my attention throughout.'), ('5', '(Mauro Lanari) Nolan plunderes humanistic and scientific disciplines to expose stories from the most bizarre perspectives on time: neuropsychopathology, Bergsonian subjectivism, thermodynamics and this time the Parmenidean aspect of Einstein\'s cosmology. The biopic would also be about the protagonists of QM, but the POV is the one hypothesized by special relativity. This explains the mistreated Fermi and the elite of quantum physics barely glimpsed in favor of the insistent comparison with the theory developed in 1905 by the Ulm physicist: not only Einstein but Thorne who is once again thanked in the credits and Oppenheimer himself with his first publication on black holes. The conception of time according to the Nobel Prize winner coincides with that of the Greek philosopher: ""the distinction between past, present, and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion"" [variant: ""it is only an illusion, however tenacious""]. Becoming is frozen in an eternal compresence of the 3 temporal extensions and the 1st act of the film is structured on the basis of such idea. Admitting its veracity, is it possible to know what it entails on a practical level? Could the principle of ethical responsibility fail? Einstein\'s answer is that everyone would act driven not by a non-existent free will but by their own predetermined nature, so much so that the sentence reported is an excerpt from the letter sent to the Besso family for the death of his friend Michele, while ataraxia and apatheia humorally disappear when it comes to taking care of the paranoid Gödel or drafting the Manifesto with Russell which was followed by the founding of Pugwash. Thus, however, the premise of the 2nd act of the film vanishes, the high school essay on the relationship between science and conscience, a question that Kubrick was able to solve with an ellipsis. Instead Nolan finds himself forced to fall back on linear diegesis by re-embracing Newtonian physics: the end of the daring experimentation and the beginning of the Hollywood blockbuster, the phase for the (successful) attempt to recover the budget starts. Then there is the 3rd act, a courtroom drama where bad and good politics (JFK) clash with Einstein on the right side. Proudhon\'s phrase attributed to Marx? A trifle. The reaction to the Trinity test of the Japanese theologian Kitamori that in 1946 devastated the Trinitarian dogmatics? For more experienced and knowledgeable filmmakers.'), ('4', 'Somehow, this movie captures the least interesting parts of a devastating war and decided to stretch them out to a bloated length. I don\'t care if RDJ thinks Oppy was a communist, there are thousands of human beings that have been turned to red mist off screen, and just because the film is suddenly black and white doesn\'t mean that people should care what\'s happening. Using the very talented Florence Pugh as a nude model to keep the audience\'s attention felt very immature. The ""become death"" scene made me feel embarrassed to have purchased tickets. Also, I genuinely believe Nolan is going deaf, as both this film and TENET are incomprehensible from an audio stabdpoint at times, with a sound mix that is bafflingly horrible.'), ('2', ""It's basically 3 continuous hours of a whole chorus of characters talking and talking, almost always, in riddles.

I will be looking forward to her future works.""), ('10', 'Writer/Director Celine Song has used her own life story to craft 2023’s best film so far. Nora is twelve years old and has a crush on her classmate Hae Song. Unfortunately for the burgeoning romance, Nora’s parents have decided to leave Seoul and immigrate to Canada. Twelve years later, Nora and Hae Song reconnect through the miracle of social media. Their relationship becomes a series of video calls where the sense of connection is palpable. Eventually though, Nora decides that they should stop talking for a while; she wants to focus on career opportunities in her new home town of New York City. Another twelve years later, Hae Song decides to vacation in New York City. It’s an opportunity for him to see a now-married Nora face-to-face for the first time in twenty-four years. It’s all sweet, sad and thoughtful. In the process, this film offers more observations about the human condition than any film in recent memory. Several elements make this film outstanding. The cast is pitch perfect. As the adult Nora, Greta Lee (“The Morning Show,” “Russian Doll,” Will Aronson’s musical “My Scary Girl”) is mesmerizing. She blends her well-honed comic timing with a sincerity and vulnerability that are irresistible. As Hae Song, Teo Yoo (“Leto,” “Decision to Leave”) is equally impressive. You can often read his emotions without a word having to be spoken. John Magaro (“The Big Short,” “First Cow”) has a smaller but still essential role as Nora’s husband, Arthur. In one of the best film scenes in recent memory, Nora and Hae Song are in a bar speaking in animated Korean while Arthur sits patiently, uncomfortably beside her. Clearly, this is a film that could have gone in a million different directions. Song deftly uses her story to explore a variety of themes – the nature of relationships, the immigrant experience, the necessary balance between work and relationships, the role of fate (and the Korean concept of “in-yun”). She does it all in an unhurried style that makes “Past Lives” feel similar to Richard Linklater’s “Before” trilogy. It’s my guess this film will be equally well-loved and critically regarded. What’s most surprising here is Song’s self-confidence as a first-time filmmaker, given that she has the additional responsibility of being true to her own story. Many of the story elements of “Past Lives” are autobiographical. Song emigrated from Korea to Canada at age 12. She, like Nora, is a playwright. She currently lives in New York City with a husband she met on a writer’s retreat, like her character. Realizing and respecting the power of her story, Song infuses this film with an unhurried pace that allows real emotions to develop and well-earned insights to come to the surface. Song has the self-confidence to highlight the power of words left unspoken. She uses her technique to convey the insurmountable gulf between two characters who, paradoxically, are standing two feet apart. Like many of the best films, “Past Lives” will serve as an incentive for self-reflection for many moviegoers. You’ll leave the theater pondering the arc of your own story and the crucial “what-ifs” that have affected your own journey. “Past Lives” is a powerful, evocative experience for any moviegoer with a beating heart.'), ('9', 'Beautifully crafted and filmed movie that touches on chance encounters as well as meaningful exchanges that alter the course of our lives but occasionally we can reflect back on without remorse.

It was directed by Joaquim Dos Santos, Kemp Powers, and Justin K. Thompson, a truly magical team. Writing credits go to Phil Lord, Chris Miller, and David Callaham. The story is about Miles Morales who catapults across the Multiverse, where he encounters a team of Spider-People charged with protecting its very existence. When the heroes clash on how to handle a new threat, Miles must redefine what it means to be a hero. THINGS I LIKED: The animation is colorful, energetic, and impressively expressive. It combines classic comic book design with modern-day CGI for a thrilling effect. Each frame looks like it came straight out of a moving comic book. Fans are completely nerding out! The cast of voice talents includes Shameik Moore, Hailee Steinfeld, Oscar Isaac, Jake Johnson, Issa Rae, Daniel Kaluuya, Jason Schwartzman, Brian Tyree Henry, J. K. Simmons, Luna Lauren Velez, Greta Lee, Rachel Dratch, Jorma Taccone, Karan Soni, and Shea Whigham. The script is extremely inventive, funny, and heartwarming all at the same time. We get some creative villains that come from various multiverses. Lots and lots of action! The movie takes place across 6 dimensions with 240 characters in it and over 1,000 animators working on it! It’s the largest crew of any animated movie ever made! So many Easter eggs. They include references to six decades of movies, video games, cartoons, and comics. Wow. This is one of those movies that you HAVE to watch more than once in order to catch everything. Scratch that…two or three times! The frames fly so fast and furiously that you simply can’t see it all. I’ve never read comic books, but I hear the movie stays true to the source material. I got a kick out of the Spot villain, the Lego spider verse, and the Indian Spider-Man. haha I’ve always loved animated movies that include live-action characters. The cliffhanger will leave you counting the days until the next installment. Surprising twists caught me off guard. Sweet. There is plenty of humor, both spoken and visual. I’ve just seen a Nicolas Cage cameo in two different movies in two days! His appearance always gets a laugh from the audience. The other is in the new movie that just came out: The Flash. It’s another fun adventure into the metaverse! You can definitely enjoy this movie without having seen the first Spider-verse one; however, you’ll understand and appreciate it even more if you have. If you love Hailee Steinfeld’s character of Gwen Stacey, you’ll be excited to know that a female-focused spin-off is currently in development. THINGS I DIDN’T LIKE: Some viewers and fans will be annoyed that the movie doesn’t actually end at the end and they’ll have to wait an entire year to see the rest of the story. Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-verse is scheduled to be released on March 29, 2024. Some of the action scenes are chaotic and happen so fast that you don’t have time to really savor the moment.

Traditionally, this could be a trite or tedious encounter, but the case becomes as much about the couple's conflicted relationship as it does the death. Hüller creates a complex character, while Graner brings depth to his struggle. In addition to solid performances, co-writer/director Justine Triet elevates what could have been dull cross-examinations into a continually compelling drama.

It’s an expertly crafted courtroom drama, and a gripping emotional story. Film buffs, be sure to add this to your watchlist, it’s a 2023 film not to be missed. Sandra (Sandra Hüller), her husband Samuel (Samuel Theis) and their son Daniel (Milo Machado Graner) live in a remote town in the French Alps. Their house is in a picturesque but very secluded location. When Samuel is found dead in the snow the police start their investigation and they quickly begin to question whether he was murdered or if he committed suicide. Sandra becomes the main suspect and a court case that initially appears as “did she really kill her husband?” goes much, much deeper. Delving headfirst into their complicated marriage, scrutinising every detail under the legal system and putting it on display for everyone to see. Anatomy of a Fall is part murder mystery, part courtroom drama and all tense crime thriller. It’s a brilliantly written story that gradually reels you in and will keep you guessing until the very end. It brings you on a psychological journey from start to finish and deals with complex relationships and how events and conversations can be interpreted. It’s so realistic and engrossing and at times feels like a true crime story. The details of the case are revealed piece by piece like a jigsaw puzzle while very effectively making you feel like you’re right there sitting in the courtroom watching the events unfold. Courtroom dramas are generally crowd pleasers, although many go way beyond reality. Anatomy of a Fall feels so genuine and chilling. Not going for the shouty outbursts or shock value, it moves along at a slow pace while also packed full of emotion from Sandra Hüller every second she’s on screen. As the viewer you’re right there in the middle of it, unsure whether she did or didn’t do it. A film that relies mainly on conversations needs a great script and the right people for the roles. Sandra Hüller as the widow standing trial and Milo Machado Graner as her son are two of the best performances I’ve seen all year. It’s all tied together with a captivating script and the whole film is a lesson on how to make a courtroom drama. Anatomy of a Fall is a gripping and engaging film by Justine Triet. A modern legal drama that’s highly recommended for everyone, and particularly those who enjoy crime thrillers and/or courtroom dramas.'), ('9', 'Superbly executed.

Directed by Justine Triet, this French film is at first glance a rather typical courtroom procedural drama. And while this is rather true in some senses, it also takes some interesting and unexpected turns, particularly in the latter half of the film as things become more clear and apparent with the trial and everything leading up to it. And while I felt as though it played things relatively safe and pedestrian for the most part, the story remains compelling enough in its own right, and Huller gives an absolute tour de force performance here. Even the young boy playing her son here also has some solid moments to shine in the film's second half in particular. Overall, it's a rather standard courtroom procedural, but some of the unexpected turns it takes midway through, along with the stellar performances from all involved make this one a worthwhile enough watch.

Every male in the show that doesn\'t suffer from some deformity (blind, missing limbs, speech impediment) is pretty much a horrible person and every female that does any type of negative action is from the result of trying to survive said patriarchy. In short, pretty much every Japanese male is bad and the worst person in the series is an European male. Also, the show tries to put the viewer in the realm of believability, yet the female samurai with seemingly little experienced training (unless this is addressed in future seasons) is able to mow down dozens of highly trained assassins and guards at a time, even when badly injured.

Also, Lena Headey is an angel and I had no clue."")}","{(8.4, ""Mandel keeps the tone light (up to a point) and the energy high, and the expansive cast includes actors with comic bona fides Ike Barinholtz, Domhnall Gleeson, and Gary Cole, most of whom show up to steal a scene or two before disappearing back into the fabric of the story. ... It's Harrelson and Theroux's show, however, and both skillfully perform the tightrope act needed to keep the series funny without ignoring the gravity of the events it depicts.""), (7.9, '“Lineage is very important to Gordon. Even more so than intelligence,” his subservient wife Fran (national treasure Judy Greer) says in one of the miniseries’ many cheeky lines of dialogue. ... The most interesting people in this story are the ones not central to it.'), (4.0, ""We're in the company of a mad man and a madman, and I couldn't wait for it to end. [8 - 21 May 2023, p.6]""), (6.7, 'It’s often fascinating viewing. However, Liddy’s Nazi fascination is just one symptom of a larger tonal problem, as the show oftentimes feels a bit glib in exploring the events that unfold, especially the ones with shocking life-and-death consequences.'), (5.0, 'White House Plumbers is a series of partially managed chaos, in which every actor in the impressive ensemble feels like they’re in a different show, and here’s the thing: The discordance is probably largely intentional and I’m confident it’s a valid interpretation of one way that Watergate probably felt from inside. It still makes for a frustrating and not wholly satisfying TV series.'), (6.3, '""White House Plumbers"" is better before it gets to Watergate, with the first half depicting how Liddy and Hunt were bombastic but somehow good at their jobs. ... The “Can you believe this actually happened?” angle of ""White House Plumbers"" loses its edge when it gets to the aftermath of Watergate and underwhelms its supporting performances.'), (5.0, 'It’s a show filled with talented, funny people, and they generally make smart decisions, especially Theroux, Gleeson, and Barinholtz. Harrelson ends up with more mixed results. ... However, a lot of the issues with Harrelson’s mediocre performance here go back to the writing, which is way too content to merely add a few jokes to the Wikipedia highlights of this story.'), (4.0, 'It’s not without funny moments, nor without interesting performances — even though leads Woody Harrelson, Justin Theroux, and Lena Headey all seem to be acting in different projects from one another — but on the whole feels like a long joke where the punchline gets repeated again and again.'), (6.0, 'In parts, “White House Plumbers” delivers a tongue-in-cheek, amply resourced reenactment from a cast and crew of HBO regulars. As a whole, the show can’t quite mount a convincing case for another piece of Watergate media, though it has fun playing in the margins.'), (5.8, 'The combination of shocking real-life events and stellar performances should spark a strong reaction but will likely evoke nothing more than a shrug at best and slight annoyance at worst. It’s a stylish watch, sure. It’s just a shame it feels like that was chosen over substance.'), (7.0, 'While sometimes White House Plumbers finds it hard to satirize what is already ridiculous at face value, it still gets off some big laughs and is bolstered by the performances of Harrelson and Theroux.'), (8.0, 'Watching their plans unravel is great fun. Perhaps too much of a lark, given Nixon’s tarnishing effect on the presidency. Americans may find it depressing – but for everyone else, it is a period hoot begging to be binged.'), (6.3, 'Don\'t come for a fresh perspective or revisionist history or faithful recounting. Do come for the laughs. ""Plumbers"" probably gets that part right anyway. ... Amusing, inconsequential.'), (6.0, 'Watergate meets “Veep” in “White House Plumbers,” an at-times-surreal HBO limited series that occasionally feels a little too over the top, mostly because the real-life characters actually were. At its best, it’s a lightweight companion to “All the President’s Men,” presenting the flip side of all that planning and frantic covering up by what amounted to Keystone Criminals.'), (8.0, 'We live, though, in uniquely incompetent times, and one of the shows that best captures this fact is a work of stylized history. White House Plumbers. .... As with traditional treatments of competence, the story delights in the details, turning Watergate into a step-by-step origin story.'), (7.5, '“White House Plumbers” likely won’t go down as the definitive Watergate tale (though a voice in Episode 4 sure seems like a nod toward one classic film), and its tone may be too indefinite to attract average TV fans. (It’s a historical drama steeped in absurd humor, just as it’s a satire absent “Veep’s” laugh-a-minute leanings.) Still, each element is made with such obvious enthusiasm for the time, place, and central story that it’s hard not to admire how the five-hour oddity adds up.'), (6.7, ""White House Plumbers thus tells a clear, coherent story about a famous event in American history, and at just five episodes there's not much bloat to complain of (though it probably could've been made as a movie in an earlier era). But those viewers looking to cackle as they did with Veep probably won't get more than an occasional chuckle.""), (8.0, 'White House Plumbers was drily funny. Harrelson and Theroux had real chemistry and Hunt and Liddy’s growing bond in a confederacy of chaos was almost touching.'), (6.3, 'Plenty of good work here. But one is left with the feeling there’s a terrific two-hour movie buried beneath this uneven five-part series.'), (8.0, 'White House Plumbers doesn’t feel pointless. The show’s ensemble cast is electric, and there’s a surprising amount of visual style to boot. Theroux and Harrelson are both stellar, but it’s the show’s delicate depiction of their characters’ real-life buffoonery that will jolt and delight both history-class dropouts and Watergate buffs alike.')}"
