Oppenheimer,2023-07-21,movie,3 h,8.9,8.7,"{'History', 'Biography', 'Drama'}",8.8,"[('4', 'Somehow, this movie captures the least interesting parts of a devastating war and decided to stretch them out to a bloated length. I don\'t care if RDJ thinks Oppy was a communist, there are thousands of human beings that have been turned to red mist off screen, and just because the film is suddenly black and white doesn\'t mean that people should care what\'s happening. Using the very talented Florence Pugh as a nude model to keep the audience\'s attention felt very immature. The ""become death"" scene made me feel embarrassed to have purchased tickets. Also, I genuinely believe Nolan is going deaf, as both this film and TENET are incomprehensible from an audio stabdpoint at times, with a sound mix that is bafflingly horrible.'), ('0', 'Boring AF. Boring because there is 0 pragmatism in the greatest minds in history. They all act like high schoolers in 40ies elites disguise.'), ('3', ""Overrated movie, don't understand the high score on IMDB. Not only was the editing horribly done and confusing, the message of the movie was highly politically biased and is basically propaganda. The movie was way too long and could have been 2 hours. And ofcourse it wouldn't be a Hollywood film if there were no misplaced sex scenes involved. The dropping of the bomb on Japan on none civilian targets was basically genocide and a war crime, but the movie didn't touch upon this subject. Also the movie fail to mention that Admiral Chester Nimitz who was in command of the pacific fleet campaign against Japan, wrote a petition to Harry S Truman personally not to use the bomb as the Japanese were about to surrender anyways. However Japan wanted to surrender to Russia under conditions. USA wanted Japan to surrender to USA unconditionally. The dropping of the bomb was therefore politically motivated and was not necessary. This is a failed opportunity of Nolan to clarify history and make this topic relevant that USA should never have built this bomb and use it and basically committed war crimes while doing so, but instead make it anti communist movie instead. The communist threat that never existed. Vietnam became a moderate country, and China is more capitalist than any western nations. The Soviet Russians became democratic and that worked out of them alot, NOT. Russia under a democracy became more military aggressive than during the Soviets communist era. Since democracies have conducted more wars the past few decades than communism, this checks out.""), ('10', ""Fantastic movie. Christopher Nolan delivered another great film and I was very pleased with the acting from everyone in it. It's long (3 hours), but definitely worth checking out.""), ('9', 'A cinematic masterpiece.

At least Nolan respects it's main characters, unlike Ridley Scott.""), ('1', ""It's so boring. Why does this show need to be so boring. I want to see bombs in this movie. It's just a bunch of people yapping. I hope this movie gets bad reviews""), ('8', 'Loved it. One of Nolan’s best.Managed to make a 3 hour court drama compelling and keep my attention throughout.'), ('10', 'A great cinematic achievement. Great acting, great sound, beautiful directing and an award worthy screenplay.'), ('7', 'This was a pretty decent movie, I was a bit disappointed when we spent 3 hours mostly listening to Oppies political views and such rather than physics. The nuclear blast was done incredibly well and you barely stop breathing just like in the movie when it happens, it was well shot and filmed. Some of the actors really fell out of place especially when they were better picks for the casting in regards to the supporting rolls. I do suggest checking it out but not on the movie theaters since the movie is very long and not worth the lengthy, they could have easily cut a decent portion of the time and it would still be good and understandable.'), ('1', 'Absolutely not an interesting film in which there are too many dialogues and not enough dynamic scenes for such a budget'), ('5', '(Mauro Lanari) Nolan plunderes humanistic and scientific disciplines to expose stories from the most bizarre perspectives on time: neuropsychopathology, Bergsonian subjectivism, thermodynamics and this time the Parmenidean aspect of Einstein\'s cosmology. The biopic would also be about the protagonists of QM, but the POV is the one hypothesized by special relativity. This explains the mistreated Fermi and the elite of quantum physics barely glimpsed in favor of the insistent comparison with the theory developed in 1905 by the Ulm physicist: not only Einstein but Thorne who is once again thanked in the credits and Oppenheimer himself with his first publication on black holes. The conception of time according to the Nobel Prize winner coincides with that of the Greek philosopher: ""the distinction between past, present, and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion"" [variant: ""it is only an illusion, however tenacious""]. Becoming is frozen in an eternal compresence of the 3 temporal extensions and the 1st act of the film is structured on the basis of such idea. Admitting its veracity, is it possible to know what it entails on a practical level? Could the principle of ethical responsibility fail? Einstein\'s answer is that everyone would act driven not by a non-existent free will but by their own predetermined nature, so much so that the sentence reported is an excerpt from the letter sent to the Besso family for the death of his friend Michele, while ataraxia and apatheia humorally disappear when it comes to taking care of the paranoid Gödel or drafting the Manifesto with Russell which was followed by the founding of Pugwash. Thus, however, the premise of the 2nd act of the film vanishes, the high school essay on the relationship between science and conscience, a question that Kubrick was able to solve with an ellipsis. Instead Nolan finds himself forced to fall back on linear diegesis by re-embracing Newtonian physics: the end of the daring experimentation and the beginning of the Hollywood blockbuster, the phase for the (successful) attempt to recover the budget starts. Then there is the 3rd act, a courtroom drama where bad and good politics (JFK) clash with Einstein on the right side. Proudhon\'s phrase attributed to Marx? A trifle. The reaction to the Trinity test of the Japanese theologian Kitamori that in 1946 devastated the Trinitarian dogmatics? For more experienced and knowledgeable filmmakers.'), ('10', '""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds."" How do I even begin to describe this movie. Why I missed it in the theaters is a mystery to me as well but man, Christopher Nolan is the single most greatest director of all time and I\'m not going to take that back. Going into this I was scared I would get bored but man from the first minute I was hooked all the way to the end. Cillian Murphy deserves an Oscar for his performance as Dr J Robert Oppenheimer. As well as Robert Downey Jr does an absolutely amazing performance as Lewis Strauss. The whole cast is absolutely amazing and the amount of detail put into this is crazy and the large ensemble is too great. Florence Pugh is one of the stars as well along with Emily Blunt. There are so much amazing things about this movie but what I love the most is the character development of Oppenheimer which is mind blowing followed by an incredible script by Nolan himself. The foreshadowing in this thing is crazy as well, the full circle moments are mind blowing as well. And of course the explosion itself doesn\'t disappoint at all, it\'s big, it\'s large and loud. Christopher Nolan is absolutely crazy for this and that\'s what makes me love him even more. The visuals as well are incredible and packed with that beautiful and suspenseful soundtrack by Ludwig Gorranson that I will listen on repeat from now. There are so much more things that I want to say that I can\'t describe in words, end of review, Christopher Nolan is 100% the greatest human being to ever make a film. Overall, after watching this I do need that JFK movie. ""Theory will only take you so far.'), ('5', ""It gets 4 for the acting which is impeccable (if misguided by the direction) but the movies itself is dreadfully boring. They took everything of interest about the making of the atomic bomb, including the devastating impacts on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and focussed instead on political intrigue which I couldn't care less about. Such a missed opportunity to make something genuinely thoughtful and moving about the horrors of nuclear weapons and a crisis of conscience. Also reminiscent of the 1980s in terms of its treatment of female characters, which are either crazy or long suffering. Very reductive.""), ('8', 'Good enough movie. One of Christopher Nolan’s mid film I will say as a causal fan of Christopher Nolan (my favorite being interstellar) a 3 hour epic of the true story of Dr. Oppenheimer and the atomic bomb. If you’re into history this movie has enough there for you, but it does fall somewhat flat at what it’s trying to do and the structure of the story is clunky and convoluted, the worst part about the movie for me. If your a film buff like myself there’s something there for you but nothing too groundbreaking other than a special effects masterclass. I did find myself somewhat dissatisfied with what I was expecting but if you go in with an open mind and not too many expectations you should enjoy it. It’s on 4k now, check it out. 7.8/10'), ('3', 'Three hours of star cast with a completely confusing, boring plot. Somehow edited together with constant time jumps.

It fully embraces the contradictions of an intellectual giant who was also a deeply flawed man, his legacy complicated by his own ambivalence toward the breakthrough achievement that secured his place in the history books.'), (10.0, 'As a filmmaker at the height of his powers, Nolan has used those prodigious skills, not simply to amaze or spectacularize, but to plunge the audience into a chapter of history that might feel ancient, as he reminds us, but happened just yesterday. By making that story so beautiful, so elegantly crafted and compulsively watchable, he has brought to life not just J. Robert Oppenheimer, but the still-crucial arguments he both started and tried to end.'), (10.0, 'For all this and more, Oppenheimer deserves the title of masterpiece. It’s Christopher Nolan’s best film so far, a step up to a new level for one of our finest filmmakers, and a movie that burns itself into your brain.'), (10.0, 'Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer is a kinetic thing of dark, imposing beauty that quakes with the disquieting tremors of a forever rupture in the course of human history.'), (10.0, 'Even when ""Oppenheimer” settles down into a more realistic, less phantasmagorical groove (which it does fairly quickly), it remains every inch a Nolan film.

Beyonce represents the American ethos of self-assured individualism about as well anyone in this film and it's hard to not feel that her approach to work sometimes veers into self-aggrandizement. It's wonderful to see the work of her many collaborators but did we also really need to see Beyonce overriding and belittling their advice? The implication in these sequences is that she is consistently combatting laziness, corner cutters and compromisers. She alone can do it. In the era of strongman politicians and megalomaniacal billionaires, is this really what we need to see?

Very understated but purposeful cinematography...'), ('10', 'Writer/Director Celine Song has used her own life story to craft 2023’s best film so far. Nora is twelve years old and has a crush on her classmate Hae Song. Unfortunately for the burgeoning romance, Nora’s parents have decided to leave Seoul and immigrate to Canada. Twelve years later, Nora and Hae Song reconnect through the miracle of social media. Their relationship becomes a series of video calls where the sense of connection is palpable. Eventually though, Nora decides that they should stop talking for a while; she wants to focus on career opportunities in her new home town of New York City. Another twelve years later, Hae Song decides to vacation in New York City. It’s an opportunity for him to see a now-married Nora face-to-face for the first time in twenty-four years. It’s all sweet, sad and thoughtful. In the process, this film offers more observations about the human condition than any film in recent memory. Several elements make this film outstanding. The cast is pitch perfect. As the adult Nora, Greta Lee (“The Morning Show,” “Russian Doll,” Will Aronson’s musical “My Scary Girl”) is mesmerizing. She blends her well-honed comic timing with a sincerity and vulnerability that are irresistible. As Hae Song, Teo Yoo (“Leto,” “Decision to Leave”) is equally impressive. You can often read his emotions without a word having to be spoken. John Magaro (“The Big Short,” “First Cow”) has a smaller but still essential role as Nora’s husband, Arthur. In one of the best film scenes in recent memory, Nora and Hae Song are in a bar speaking in animated Korean while Arthur sits patiently, uncomfortably beside her. Clearly, this is a film that could have gone in a million different directions. Song deftly uses her story to explore a variety of themes – the nature of relationships, the immigrant experience, the necessary balance between work and relationships, the role of fate (and the Korean concept of “in-yun”). She does it all in an unhurried style that makes “Past Lives” feel similar to Richard Linklater’s “Before” trilogy. It’s my guess this film will be equally well-loved and critically regarded. What’s most surprising here is Song’s self-confidence as a first-time filmmaker, given that she has the additional responsibility of being true to her own story. Many of the story elements of “Past Lives” are autobiographical. Song emigrated from Korea to Canada at age 12. She, like Nora, is a playwright. She currently lives in New York City with a husband she met on a writer’s retreat, like her character. Realizing and respecting the power of her story, Song infuses this film with an unhurried pace that allows real emotions to develop and well-earned insights to come to the surface. Song has the self-confidence to highlight the power of words left unspoken. She uses her technique to convey the insurmountable gulf between two characters who, paradoxically, are standing two feet apart. Like many of the best films, “Past Lives” will serve as an incentive for self-reflection for many moviegoers. You’ll leave the theater pondering the arc of your own story and the crucial “what-ifs” that have affected your own journey. “Past Lives” is a powerful, evocative experience for any moviegoer with a beating heart.'), ('8', 'One of the best films of year by a first-time director.

Sweet! Fans are thrilled, rewarding the movie with $221 million at the worldwide opening. It was directed by Joaquim Dos Santos, Kemp Powers, and Justin K. Thompson, a truly magical team. Writing credits go to Phil Lord, Chris Miller, and David Callaham. The story is about Miles Morales who catapults across the Multiverse, where he encounters a team of Spider-People charged with protecting its very existence. When the heroes clash on how to handle a new threat, Miles must redefine what it means to be a hero. THINGS I LIKED: The animation is colorful, energetic, and impressively expressive. It combines classic comic book design with modern-day CGI for a thrilling effect. Each frame looks like it came straight out of a moving comic book. Fans are completely nerding out! The cast of voice talents includes Shameik Moore, Hailee Steinfeld, Oscar Isaac, Jake Johnson, Issa Rae, Daniel Kaluuya, Jason Schwartzman, Brian Tyree Henry, J. K. Simmons, Luna Lauren Velez, Greta Lee, Rachel Dratch, Jorma Taccone, Karan Soni, and Shea Whigham. The script is extremely inventive, funny, and heartwarming all at the same time. We get some creative villains that come from various multiverses. Lots and lots of action! The movie takes place across 6 dimensions with 240 characters in it and over 1,000 animators working on it! It’s the largest crew of any animated movie ever made! So many Easter eggs. They include references to six decades of movies, video games, cartoons, and comics. Wow. This is one of those movies that you HAVE to watch more than once in order to catch everything. Scratch that…two or three times! The frames fly so fast and furiously that you simply can’t see it all. I’ve never read comic books, but I hear the movie stays true to the source material. I got a kick out of the Spot villain, the Lego spider verse, and the Indian Spider-Man. haha I’ve always loved animated movies that include live-action characters. The cliffhanger will leave you counting the days until the next installment. Surprising twists caught me off guard. Sweet. There is plenty of humor, both spoken and visual. I’ve just seen a Nicolas Cage cameo in two different movies in two days! His appearance always gets a laugh from the audience. The other is in the new movie that just came out: The Flash. It’s another fun adventure into the metaverse! You can definitely enjoy this movie without having seen the first Spider-verse one; however, you’ll understand and appreciate it even more if you have. If you love Hailee Steinfeld’s character of Gwen Stacey, you’ll be excited to know that a female-focused spin-off is currently in development. THINGS I DIDN’T LIKE: Some viewers and fans will be annoyed that the movie doesn’t actually end at the end and they’ll have to wait an entire year to see the rest of the story. Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-verse is scheduled to be released on March 29, 2024. Some of the action scenes are chaotic and happen so fast that you don’t have time to really savor the moment.

Some Spanish is spoken without subtitles.'), ('6', 'Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is a visually impressive film that delivers on its promise of spectacle and manages to entertain with its chaotic narrative. However, it has lost its essence, at least for me, and has dramatically diminished the meaning of the costume.

It\'s entirely absurd in a story where even the Elephant appears as Spider-Man within an intergalactic organization. I was pretty excited when the multiverse idea was first introduced.

Like many other Scorsese films, Killers of the Flower Moon explores how evil emerges in a family community and takes control of men\'s actions. Different from other Scorsese films however, the pace doesn\'t accelerate as the film progresses. If anything, it seems to slow down: months and even years seem to go by in the first thirty minutes of the film, while a few days capture the last hour. It seems like historic Scorsese films like The Age of Innocence, Gangs of New York, Silence and this film share the characteristic of a steady, calmer pace, as if the distance of time allowed for a more balanced approach to the material. Running at three and a half hours without the entertaining excesses of Goodfellas or the Wolf of Wall Street, it is not surprising that the film has delivered mixed results at the box office. And yet it\'s as relevant, engaging and disturbing as any other Scorsese film. The film doesn\'t hide its societal point of view, and addresses head on the topic of repression of Native Americans by white populations in American history in the most unequivocal of ways. But running as an undercurrent throughout the film lies another of today\'s hot topics, which is the right of representation (understood as the right to represent something in art, or in this case on the screen). Who is Martin Scorsese to make a film about the abuses to Native Americans by white men? Is it okay that he made the film with the main characters and actors being two white men? Scorsese states in a pre-roll shown before the start of the film that its story was of particular ""personal relevance"" to him. In what way? In making Killers of the Flower Moon, Scorsese states that repression of any person or population is never someone else\'s problem. It\'s ours, and should feel personal to all of us. Representing it on screen is not stealing someone else\'s rights, but on the contrary opening ourselves to the pain of others. That possibility of understanding a different human group, for a filmmaker who made his fame and fortune focusing narrowly on his native New York, is the ultimate theme of the film. Killers of the Flower is masterfully directed by Martin Scorsese and brilliantly acted by Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro and Lily Gladstone. One can only be in awe at how every shot, every camera movement has a purpose, contributes to the story and reminds you of how great an art filmmaking can be. Every scene that Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro are together on is like an acting masterclass. It is a luxury to see these two great actors playing together.'), ('7', 'It was serviceable.

Scorcese’s choice to focus the story on the “tortured soul” of a dimwitted man and his manipulative genocidal uncle is a destructive waste of time and possibilities. I wonder - what could have this film been with one Indigenous person involved in a leading creative role? There is something much more profound rumbling beneath this Hollywood interpretation of history. Lily Gladstone and every Indigenous actor in this film are stones washing ashore in a storm. They shine, and make the most when given sips of air to breath, offering respite from torture with grace, humility, edge, and spirit. Gladstone’s undoubtedly complex, yet unrealized character Molly is still relegated to a filmmaker afterthought. The Osage people are treated as dogs, poisoned, shot, and do basically nothing to look into how their people are dying. How is this entertainment or helpful to ending the cycle of colonization and stigmatization of Indigenous people as victims? I understand the Osage people hope it is helpful to their people and gets the story out, but, I just don't know. You can tell there is something off when filmmakers feel the need to open their film with a personal disclaimer about how much they wanted to make a movie, and then close it with themselves.

I was not prepared for a show with such genuine, complex, well-written, well-acted, believable, and sympathetic characters. Is it a comedy with tragic moments? Is it a tragedy with comedic moments? It works as both. I laughed consistently. I was nearly moved to tears on multiple occasions. The characters are nuanced, complex, and dynamic.

To watch her try to pull one over on a world that rewards sensibility is extraordinarily fun, and the rest of the show keeps pace one perfect half-step behind the viewer.'), (7.5, 'The show might not be everyone’s cup of tea because it demands fortitude. While the early episodes are enjoyable, High Desert shapes itself into a more insightful version over the remaining tightly paced outings.'), (7.5, 'While there’s an ensemble of kooky characters around her, this is a showcase for Arquette’s unique energy. There’s a vulnerability at her core, but also the frankness of someone who has spent most of her life operating on survival mode.'), (7.5, 'What may, at times, feel like too much, always stays true to its own kooky vision, and as a showcase for Arquette (who also executive produces), “High Desert” provides an ample spotlight. It won’t be for everyone, but neither is a 75-degree Thanksgiving.'), (7.0, 'High Desert’s early aimlessness evolves by midseason into a likable shagginess, warmed by a surprising amount of heart.'), (7.0, 'What keeps “High Desert” from greatness (though there is hope, if it gets another season!) is a failure to unite the farcical stuff, much of which is delightful, with the deeper story. The plot starts to feel so crowded, rushed and messy that the finale (critics got all eight episodes) at times feels as if it was written by — rather than for — Peggy.'), (7.0, ""She may sound unbearable. She can certainly cause a cringe or two.

Arquette rocks here yet again, holding “High Desert” together even as it threatens to wander off into the barren TV landscape.'), (6.0, 'That it makes sense at all is down to Arquette, whose powerful charisma draws the whole thing together. ... Otherwise, High Desert is very much a case of style over substance. It looks gorgeous, there is an endless parade of side characters, each brighter and kookier than the last, and the New Agey energy and stupidity of southern California is at least as much a presence as they are. But there is too much going on to allow the viewer to care about any of it other than Peggy herself.'), (6.0, 'High Desert strives for the free-flowing zaniness of an acid trip – but can’t quite conjure the accompanying profundity. As an off-beat exploration of grief, addiction, and recovery, though, it’s refreshingly easy to digest.'), (6.0, 'There’s lots going on. If you are looking for a calm, measured drama, High Desert is not for you. But Arquette is well cast, and her charisma propels the series through its changes of tone.'), (6.0, '“High Desert” takes an actor in the ensemble of a more high-profile Apple project and hands them the spotlight, with mixed results.

There are great performances throuughout, fantastic dialogue, with great humour, veering from sharp wit into pure farce, thoroughly entertaining throughout. Justin Theroux is stellar.'), ('6', 'Woody Harrelson, Justin Theroux and Lena Headey are all excellent in this miniseries, especially Theroux, but Watergate is a topic that is already too burned out to matter anymore, especially when US political standards are at rock bottom. I mean Nixon was forced to resign back then, even with pressure from his own party, but with the likes of Trump, Matt Gaetz, Ted Cruz, Greg Abbott, Lauren Boebert and the detestable Marjorie Taylor Greene, a single incident of election spying seems meaningless compared to them.'), ('10', ""Always have loved Woody. Have even liked Theroux since The Leftovers. But dear lord, these two together are something else! Take the the chemistry from True Detective S1 and then make it goofy - This is what we're working with and it's amazing. Also, Lena Headey is an angel and I had no clue.""), ('10', ""I am with all the 10 ratings here. This is an excellent show. Funny, riviting, well acted, lots of star power and fun characters. And it is a great way for the gen X and X'ers to learn a little history. Not sure why the critics were not as positive as the rest of us.""), ('10', ""It's from producers of Succession, so I had to check it out. And it's great! Similar tone, but maybe a little more comedy, at least for the first two episodes.""), ('10', ""Episode 2 was phenomenal, can't believe how great Kathleen Turner was. Her scene with Justin Theroux was especially hilarious, this show keeps getting better.""), ('10', 'Woody Harrelson is my favorite actor of all time, and this show uses all of his skills. Funny, dramatic, sad - Woody can do it all. And Justin Theroux is amazing as his counter part, the perfect duo.'), ('10', ""Don't sleep on this show! I saw a promo for it after Succession, and figured it was worth checking out. It's so good! Great blend of comedy and drama, and amazing cast. Loved it.""), ('10', ""If the first episode is any indication, HBO has another classic limited series on its hands. Can't wait for episode 2!""), ('0', 'I am sad, I was looking forward to this show but it is just cringe, not funny and lacks any quality.')]","[(8.4, ""Mandel keeps the tone light (up to a point) and the energy high, and the expansive cast includes actors with comic bona fides Ike Barinholtz, Domhnall Gleeson, and Gary Cole, most of whom show up to steal a scene or two before disappearing back into the fabric of the story. ... It's Harrelson and Theroux's show, however, and both skillfully perform the tightrope act needed to keep the series funny without ignoring the gravity of the events it depicts.""), (8.0, 'White House Plumbers doesn’t feel pointless. The show’s ensemble cast is electric, and there’s a surprising amount of visual style to boot. Theroux and Harrelson are both stellar, but it’s the show’s delicate depiction of their characters’ real-life buffoonery that will jolt and delight both history-class dropouts and Watergate buffs alike.'), (8.0, 'We live, though, in uniquely incompetent times, and one of the shows that best captures this fact is a work of stylized history. White House Plumbers. .... As with traditional treatments of competence, the story delights in the details, turning Watergate into a step-by-step origin story.'), (8.0, 'Watching their plans unravel is great fun. Perhaps too much of a lark, given Nixon’s tarnishing effect on the presidency. Americans may find it depressing – but for everyone else, it is a period hoot begging to be binged.'), (8.0, 'White House Plumbers was drily funny. Harrelson and Theroux had real chemistry and Hunt and Liddy’s growing bond in a confederacy of chaos was almost touching.'), (7.9, '“Lineage is very important to Gordon. Even more so than intelligence,” his subservient wife Fran (national treasure Judy Greer) says in one of the miniseries’ many cheeky lines of dialogue. ... The most interesting people in this story are the ones not central to it.'), (7.5, '“White House Plumbers” likely won’t go down as the definitive Watergate tale (though a voice in Episode 4 sure seems like a nod toward one classic film), and its tone may be too indefinite to attract average TV fans. (It’s a historical drama steeped in absurd humor, just as it’s a satire absent “Veep’s” laugh-a-minute leanings.) Still, each element is made with such obvious enthusiasm for the time, place, and central story that it’s hard not to admire how the five-hour oddity adds up.'), (7.0, 'While sometimes White House Plumbers finds it hard to satirize what is already ridiculous at face value, it still gets off some big laughs and is bolstered by the performances of Harrelson and Theroux.'), (6.7, 'It’s often fascinating viewing. However, Liddy’s Nazi fascination is just one symptom of a larger tonal problem, as the show oftentimes feels a bit glib in exploring the events that unfold, especially the ones with shocking life-and-death consequences.'), (6.7, ""White House Plumbers thus tells a clear, coherent story about a famous event in American history, and at just five episodes there's not much bloat to complain of (though it probably could've been made as a movie in an earlier era).

But one is left with the feeling there’s a terrific two-hour movie buried beneath this uneven five-part series.'), (6.3, 'Don\'t come for a fresh perspective or revisionist history or faithful recounting. Do come for the laughs. ""Plumbers"" probably gets that part right anyway. ... Amusing, inconsequential.'), (6.0, 'Watergate meets “Veep” in “White House Plumbers,” an at-times-surreal HBO limited series that occasionally feels a little too over the top, mostly because the real-life characters actually were. At its best, it’s a lightweight companion to “All the President’s Men,” presenting the flip side of all that planning and frantic covering up by what amounted to Keystone Criminals.'), (6.0, 'In parts, “White House Plumbers” delivers a tongue-in-cheek, amply resourced reenactment from a cast and crew of HBO regulars. As a whole, the show can’t quite mount a convincing case for another piece of Watergate media, though it has fun playing in the margins.'), (5.8, 'The combination of shocking real-life events and stellar performances should spark a strong reaction but will likely evoke nothing more than a shrug at best and slight annoyance at worst. It’s a stylish watch, sure. It’s just a shame it feels like that was chosen over substance.'), (5.0, 'It’s a show filled with talented, funny people, and they generally make smart decisions, especially Theroux, Gleeson, and Barinholtz. Harrelson ends up with more mixed results. ... However, a lot of the issues with Harrelson’s mediocre performance here go back to the writing, which is way too content to merely add a few jokes to the Wikipedia highlights of this story.'), (5.0, 'White House Plumbers is a series of partially managed chaos, in which every actor in the impressive ensemble feels like they’re in a different show, and here’s the thing: The discordance is probably largely intentional and I’m confident it’s a valid interpretation of one way that Watergate probably felt from inside. It still makes for a frustrating and not wholly satisfying TV series.'), (4.0, 'It’s not without funny moments, nor without interesting performances — even though leads Woody Harrelson, Justin Theroux, and Lena Headey all seem to be acting in different projects from one another — but on the whole feels like a long joke where the punchline gets repeated again and again.'), (4.0, ""We're in the company of a mad man and a madman, and I couldn't wait for it to end.
