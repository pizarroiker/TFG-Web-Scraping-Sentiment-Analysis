Suzume,2023-04-14,movie,2 h 2 m,,,"{'Action', 'Animation', 'Fantasy', 'Adventure'}",,"[('8', 'It’s another great film by Makoto Shinkai. Absolutely worth watching. It’s genuinely feel like you’ve observed Suzume going on a journey. Unfortunaly it sounds like there was a lot of interference by his editor who forced in the romance elements that never truly feel like it naturally fitted within the plot. So that does work against it and stops this film from being one of his all time greats. The funny thing is, that if Hayao Miyazaki’s last film (The Boy and the Heron) wasn’t released around the same time we could have seen this nominated at the Oscars.'), ('10', 'Its one of my favourite movies tbh. I think its a great film for everyone especially fans of your name kimi no na wa. Music Landscape Characters and generally story is more depressing but still with jokes and a happy feeling. So i gotta say its a 10/10'), ('7', 'Yet another entry in the highly melodramatic, magical realism tales that have overtaken anime. Imperfect, but very high quality in its production.'), ('0', 'Seemed like a great movie at first, however the ending was incredibly sad and anti-kitty.

It is great if you like anime and is low cost.'), ('10', 'I really love this movie it really opens our imagination and looks more thing go beyond on what we expect'), ('10', 'This movie is really good!

If the length of this work was more than 3 hours, it would have been able to complete the story that could have been told, instead of being like now, with incomprehensible emotions, unorganized plot, ridiculous character relationships, and abnormal action logic. But when you understand this work, you will find that the intention of this work is very good. In fact, most of the behaviors in it can be explained. For most people, it is over after watching it once and they cannot understand it. Of course, I am the same. . So I feel pity for this work, it could have been better""), ('10', ""The best animated family film I've ever watched! Suzume makes a great protagonist and role model for girls. The effervescent humor keeps balances out the tragedy in the story. This film is based on two things: Japanese earthquakes, including the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami which claimed almost 20,000 lives, and also the existence of ruins in Japan due to depopulation. The film being based on these serious events make it more meaningful and real. This is a film which audiences of any age will enjoy. Watch Suzume, you won't regret it!""), ('6', 'They show this handsome guy in a trailer, but in reality he gets like 5 minutes of screen time. It made me feel kind of disappointed. The main storyline was rather childish, which is no surprise, given the characters. Not ""childish"", as in ""fairytale"", but as in ""made for kids"". There is no drama, no love story- it is just hollow (like moving from 1 quest marker to another), filled with nice visuals. Here is a joke, here is a cute scene, here is an action sequence. Here is a picture of a landscape for 10 seconds. Yeah, we get it, you know how to paint over a photograph, and you have a huge budget. But, at the same time, we know absolutely nothing about how the main character feels, or what they think. One could replace them with a soulless robot, or a wooden stick, and almost nothing would change. Even more, some of the characters have no personality at all. They just do whatever a plot requires them to, like turning from friends to enemies and back for absolutely no reason. Nevertheless, the plot did keep me entertained till the very end. It was unpredictable, for the most part, and fun to watch. All in all, I have mixed feelings about this one. They did put a lot of money on the table: stunning visuals (excluding those ugly 3d scenes), original music, beautiful voice acting, all sorts of ads and promo materials. But, in the end, it all comes down to the plot- and while secondary characters are amazing, I can\'t name a single main character who did not disappoint me. I would never watch it for the second time.'), ('9', 'Makoto Shinkai once again brings us a visually brilliant and very intense film, with charismatic characters (from the main characters to the supporting characters), beautiful music and a remarkable score. Although it\'s not perfect - at times it sounds very dragged out in its development, in addition to some script decisions that deserve a little questioning - ""Suzume"" deserves its status as a spectacle, knowing how to captivate the audience and bring them exciting moments, walking between melancholy and hope, between drama and humor in a very organic way, without sounding forced.'), ('10', 'Thank you for sharing your emotions and experience through this movie. This is one of the best story telling pieces i have seen and i am glad i did. It was bautiful.'), ('9', 'a highly recommended movie. The animation is amazing and the story is very touching.'), ('9', ""Another masterpiece from Makoto Shinkai. The soundtrack is one of the best ever from his movies! Visually it's also perfect, the animation is breathtaking! Just a few story gaps, otherwise would be a 10!""), ('9', ""Suzume was fun to watch. The story makes you feels the struggle and slowly set you up for a very emotional ending. This talk about lost and love in more then one way. Yet, it has a sens of joy and innocence that is refreshing (like Spirited Away has). You also have a sens of pause like Ghibli is able to do. The animation is superb. The music is great. And you will cry at the ending. Movie in japanese with english sub. I give it 88%. I really don't have anything bad to say about it. Go see it.""), ('10', 'The film is just incredible, I\'m glad I saw it. The film tells a wonderful story. The film doesn\'t have just one genre, there\'s a bit of everything. The exterior of the film is also incredibly beautiful. Every little detail is drawn in this film. The music is perfectly integrated into the film and not only the song from the trailer, but many others were great. I found the allusion to Tōhoku interesting. The ending of ""Suzume"" is different from ""Your Name"" and ""Weathering with you"" because it doesn\'t really show that they will be together in the end. I think it\'s just as good as ""Your Name"" and ""Weathering with you"".'), ('9', ""awesome anime of japan, good story, awesome visuals, great music just like last movie 'you name'. see it in theatre.""), ('8', ""Dubbed as the next Miyazaki, Makoto Shinkai is probably Japan's number one director. His films somehow hit the mark on Anime fans worldwide. This winning streak continues with Suzume, which offers a magical, supernatural trip of 2 protagonists across Japan. Of course, there seems to be a 'formula' that Shinkai employs and after 3 'hit' movies in, you can see a certain pattern. Miyazaki's films on the other hand dared to go to different directions, whether the audiences like it or not, and in that sense has incredible originality that Shinkai's works are missing. Nevertheless, it's a big hit and it is still an enjoyable, yet slightly predicable ride.""), ('10', 'Loved this. Another masterpiece by Makoto Shinkai. A mesmerising tale of courage, longing, grief and love.'), ('10', 'Really wonderfull film about the discovery and evolution of the feelings of a adolescent, not the easiest film to follow for young people as it use a gigantic McGuffing to keep the film going. Really wonderfull animation (the lighting take your breath away if a 200% Shinkai technical roadshow)'), ('10', ""Tragedy and loss, united in a story acting as the backbone in which magic is the engine. The two hours of footage move in a way that doesn't feel like it and the viewer is completely wrapped up in the plot. If this movie doesn't make it to next year's awards ceremonies, something is wrong.""), ('9', 'I love the story, the visual, the music. Major characters have strong and persistent personalities, and supporting figures are interesting and attractive.'), ('10', 'Such an awe inspiring movie that loves the soul! Might be his best work yet!'), ('7', 'The animation is stunning and the production values are top notch. The animators should be proud of themselves and that should not be discounted. With that said, the actual story was a bit… weak. It was a good movie but it felt like it was missing something. Definitely does not meet the lofty expectations of Your Name or even 5 Centimeters per Second. Worth a watch but probably won’t stick with you. Especially if you’re expecting another masterpiece'), ('10', ""Absolutely jaw-dropping movie. One could argue that that's to be expected from Makoto Shinkai.

A must-watch.""), ('10', 'Just Watching at Malaysia，nice director，actor and music.I’m already looking forward to the next movie.'), ('8', ""The animation is beautiful. The director is becoming one of my favorites. With Your Name, Weathering With You, and now Suzume. You can always expect a thought provoking story. My viewing was with subtitles because I prefer hearing the emotion from the original voice actors. I can't recommend it enough.""), ('10', 'A very mesmerizing, exquisite, breathtaking anime masterpiece that tells a very beautiful story with refreshing comical elements and complete character development.

Suzume, who at first seems like just another standard-issue anime ingenue, grows and becomes more interesting throughout.'), (9.0, 'Suzume is a captivating film that depicts the grieving process in a creative and thoughtful manner. It features a strong cast, a moving score, and some truly amazing animation.'), (9.0, 'Suzume may be a less effective romance than something like Your Name — it’s tough when half of your main pairing is a piece of furniture — but that’s because its real love story is with the stuff of everyday life, making it almost unbearably inviting and worth fighting for.'), (9.0, 'Thematically and artistically, Suzume is a gem.

At its heart, there is a story worth caring about.'), (8.0, 'In Suzume, though, Shinkai goes full Ghibli, peppering his story of a teenage girl (voiced by Nanoka Hara) on a mission with oddball elements that would feel off-puttingly bizarre were they not incorporated so seamlessly within its epic grand design.'), (7.8, 'Where Shinkai remains peerless is in taking those big, magical, melodramatic swings and landing them with a gentle, compassionate touch.'), (7.5, ""Shinkai uses magnificent landscapes as the background of a story about love, trauma, and finding out who you are. There's much to love about Suzume, and more than enough for us to be excited about whatever the filmmaker comes up with next.""), (7.5, 'The film is consistently delightful, offering up an unrelenting supply of shimmering, sun-dappled visuals and a sweet, strange story about a young girl making peace with her past.'), (7.5, 'Shinkai is back with another magical teen story in Suzume, which got me in the gut yet again. '), (7.5, 'There are key elements of Suzume that directly speak to the history of Japan and the fears of its people, but Shinkai’s gift is his ability to make the issues of trauma and anxiety feel like everyone’s. “Suzume” isn’t quite the masterpiece that is “Your Name” but I wouldn’t blame anyone for falling in love with it.'), (7.5, 'Suzume is Shinkai’s biggest and possibly most complex movie, and parts of it feel more personal due to the invocation of real history, but it’s also a bit overly concerned with its plot—to the point where it seems to take its central relationship for granted.'), (7.0, 'It’s not just the drama that works. Shinkai delivers hilarious physical comedy in the awkward gambols and leaps of Souta the three-legged chair — a refreshing reversal of the trope of the handsome young love interest who leads the naïve girl on a journey.'), (7.0, 'At its best, Suzume is a film that imagines modern Japan as a post-apocalyptic setting, evoking the animated beauty and “mono no aware” of pastoral iyashikei like Yokohama Kaidashi Kikou.'), (6.0, 'It is an absorbing, intriguing, bewildering work: often spectacular and beautiful, like a sci-fi supernatural disaster movie or an essay on nature and politics, but shot through with distinctive elements of fey and whimsical comedy.'), (6.0, 'Shinkai casts a spell in the moment, but the magic fades away.'), (5.0, 'In Suzume, they deliver a general lack of focus or full realization of any one of dozens of well-intentioned ideas.'), (5.0, 'For a director whose career has centered human connection at every turn to create some of the most vulnerable and emotional stories on romance and human connection within the field of Japanese animation, it feels like a rare misfire.')]"

I don\'t know how to put it any other way. Every single scene is a caricature of previous Indie movies or adventures in general.

The plot is ridiculous at times and thus did absoulutely not need to have a 300 mil $ budget. But I still liked the action and setpieces.

A better job could not have been done in rounding out the beloved characters and series. The storyline did exactly that, gracefully, and with respect and dignity from start to finish, giving us everything we could want for Indy\'s last adventure. Harrison Ford is perfection as an older version of his iconic character, and I love that they did not shy away from but rather embraced his age with charm and humor. The appearances of Sallah and Marion nearly brought tears to my eyes, and the casting of the new characters was inspired. The special effects are as wonderful as always, in particular Indy\'s digitally-enhanced younger self. The cornucopia of sets and costumes are amazing in their authenticity, detail and diversity, and the score is, of course, everything we\'ve come to expect and then some. The icing on the cake is the reenactment of the ""where doesn\'t it hurt?"" scene. It was emotional and heartwarming seeing the two characters come full circle from the very first film; I can\'t think of a more perfect way to wrap up Indy\'s adventures and to pay tribute and say goodbye to the characters we\'ve come to love. Harrison Ford said he wouldn\'t miss Indy because he had ""fullfilled his purpose."" I agree with him on the latter but not so much the former. I will miss Indiana Jones very much.

Disney please leave these franchises alone,they had their time before make something new. As for you Kathleen, it is clear that you have no idea what you are doing, I still wonder why George even gave his beloved franchises to Disney in the first place, only to be mistreated.

I am a bit contrary to most Indy fans out there, I really like Crystal Skull and dislike Temple of Doom, I know I'll get hate for saying this, but it's just so you know where I stand when it comes to this franchise. Helena (Phoebe Waller-Bridge) can be annoying at first, but she manages to become likable as the movie progress.

From a directorial point of view, in particular, Christopher McQuarrie confirms himself as one of the most capable action moviemakers of recent years, managing to put together an extreme variety of action scenes that are different from each other in a memorable and adrenaline-filled way. Nonetheless, however, the direction also seems to want to emulate the style of Brian de Palma, already director of the first chapter, and the insistent use of Dutch angles and close-ups turns out to be a mere exercise in style rather than a truly inspired choice. From a narrative point of view the plot becomes more understandable after two or three viewings of the movie, since at first it appears to be excessively convoluted but once unraveled it acquires a very high degree of entertainment. The choice to divide the movie into two parts is unjustified and this is noticeable due to the unnecessarily long duration of this part one. Numerous action scenes last longer than they should and some events are extremely dilated in time. Nonetheless, the movie is in no way boring and the stunts, which are now an integral part of what elevates the Mission Impossible saga above the average of other action franchises, always keep the viewer in suspense and are worthy of be appreciated in style at the cinema.'), ('7', 'While it was a good movie and the action and stunts were of course amazing as you can expect from Tom Cruise, the plot in my opinion could have been a bit better.

This movie’s compelling and timely plot and well written script have become extremely rare qualities in film in this age of industry desperation, abuse, greed and partisan political rhetoric. Dead Reckoning: Part One accurately portrays the noble qualities of humanity in juxtaposition with its selfish chaos while simultaneously presenting the very real and rising threat to our entire race in the form of an extremely advanced and, perhaps, unbeatable opponent: Artificial Intelligence. Lorne Balfe, whose Hollywood credits are endless, delivers a stunning musical score. Perfection does exist in cinema, and many Hollywood titles achieve it. Dead Reckoning comes strikingly close, with clear and concise dialogue, Hollywood’s greatest acting talents, and exceptional cinematography from Fraser Taggart.

Seriously, damn this film hits, now granted there are a few problems, some may notice that there are silent action scenes in here, and while I would prefer the music to represent what's going on in the film, they chose to keep some scenes completely silent of music for extended periods. What is interesting is that even when there are potential flaws in this film, my eyes are glued to the screen and the true reason why I'm giving it an 8/10 is because, well it is the first part of two films and the music score isn't as powerful as it was in Fallout. But anyway, The big question is, should you watch this? It is a definite YES, but watch it as late as you can so you don't have to wait so long for Part 2.

Sometimes it felt a little too clean and crisp for such a frantic franchise, but that\'s probably me nitpicking. Overall they were great. The characters felt pretty flat overall, an exception for me was Alyssa Sutherland (Ellie, the mother) who did a pretty decent job. The rest of the characters felt unmemorable. I just didn\'t feel much of a connection to any of them and there wasn\'t much development or performances that stood out to me. Some people are crying about an all-female primary cast or ""woke"" kid characters, but that had zero impact on why I wasn\'t very impressed. All of that weird, political pontification is irrelevant in my opinion. There wasn\'t a lot to the story and the writing/dialogue wasn\'t particularly impressive. A lot of it felt average at best. At times the film relied too much on predictable jump scares and not the kind of horror that sticks with you. The original movies found a way to weave in a demented sense of fun or goofiness along with moments of trippy psychedelia that were absent in this iteration. It picked up a bit more at the end, but I had hoped for more of that throughout the movie. Some of the CGI was spotty in certain scenes. Part of why I loved the originals so much involved the craft and effort put into a lot of the special effects, gore, and action. This felt a bit more dialed in when it comes to these aspects. Overall, it was a little better than the average possession movie I see these days, but a little below average when you consider the franchise it\'s a part of. There were some decent nods and references to the originals, but it didn\'t quite have the same spirit - the execution felt a bit off. I would maybe give it a 6.5 if I could, but will lean more towards a 6 given the options available to me.

Bill's episode was genuinely one of the best episodes of tv that I've watched in a long time - albeit, a bit of a curveball with respect to the pace of the story. It perfectly embodied that The Last of Us is supposed to be about - clinging on to your humanity at any cost in a world where that could prove to be your undoing (in this case, paying off fairly well for Bill - but as the show and game have shown us, it normally doesn't). They tried to replicate this later in the season with Ellie's story but that didn't stick the landing as much for me as Bill's episode. Honestly, if it wasn't for how well done episode 3 was, I'd probably rate the show a 6 out of 10. On that note, the ending of the game was so well executed that it left most players speechless. It was a moral gray area that led to great debate and the ending is what catapulted the game from being good to being great. Clearly, Druckmann wasn't happy with the fanbase who supported Joel's end game choices - as the ending of the show was far less gray - making it far less interesting, bordering on eye rolling. Acting and production are both really well done. Although, I'll admit - I don't think Bella Ramsey pulls off the same charm as Ellie in the game. Not to be nit picky, but it's too apparent that she is playing a character rather than embodying/becoming the character. It takes me out of the story.

The show becomes increasingly formulaic with less mystery and less believability in each new episode. I'd say it's a 7 for the first 2 episodes, trending towards a 4 later in the season. I stopped watching at ep 7.""), ('8', '(Ep 1 ""Dead Man\'s Hand"" + Ep 2 ""The Night Shift"") A waitress named Charlie with a gift for detecting deception gets recruited by a casino boss to exploit a high-roller\'s poker game, while she deals with her friend\'s violent murder. Charlie then hits the road, but finds herself poking around the apparent wrongful arrest of a helpful trucker she meets at a remote rest stop. Charlie is played by Natasha Lyonne as a Columbo-type sleuth who is also a self-described dumbass. Like Columbo she is usually an apologetic and unthreatening interrogator, but unlike Columbo you know that sometimes she is not just PLAYING dumb. She keeps stumbling into obstacles or solutions without knowing how or if she can master or learn from the experience. The nominal hook for the series is Charlie\'s seemingly infallible gift for smelling out intentionally deceptive utterances. That ability gets less focus in the initial episodes than one might expect, and is downplayed by Charlie herself as a source of frustration and confusion.I expect from Rian Johnston\'s past screenwriting that POKER FACE will eventually mine the premise for clever twists and payoffs. However, that isn’t strongly evident in the openering stories. They presumably have to focus more on establishing the character and the series\' plot arc. These lean engaging and clear mystery/crime storytelling that is still pretty conventional. If anything, POKER FACE is more distinguished by how Charlie\'s amateur investigator status lends dramatic weight to her personal confrontations with perpetrators. This show is a great vehicle for Natasha Lyonne\'s anti-glamorous screen persona as a bed-headed working-class day-drinker. She gets the best moments in the episodes viewed: an excited off-screen reaction to a luxurious private chamber; and a charming delivery of the line, ""I\'m gonna... accept this situation."": her bemused reaction to waking up somewhere unexpected. A low-expectations attitude to her abilities and to looming threats make her an exception to the variously committed and well-resourced law-enforcement and P.I. types who populate crime shows. It makes it harder for writers to insert high stakes into her stories, but it does make her more relatable. By default she wants to ignore people\'s lies and manipulations and avoid involvement, but she is torn by the impulse to keep poking her nose where it is not welcome because something just doesn\'t feel right. Rather than being a crime buster straight out of the gate, she is going to have to learn as she goes without much support. You could say that Charlie is the detective character updated for the current generation living in the casual-employment/gig-work/side-hustle economy. Outside of the likeable lead, most of the other elements of the series are pretty solid, if occasionally requiring some commitment from the viewer . The hour-plus run times that streaming makes possible enabled lots of setup for ongoing character arcs in episode one but also was used to lay out multiple additional characters in the new setting Charlie arrives at while on the road in episode two. Hopefully the episode scripts get a bit tighter as the series progresses. The first two episodes use a version of the crime solving narrative format used in Columbo and Law and Order: Criminal Intent. That is, we are shown up front the events of the crime, and the question to be resolved is not whodunnit but how close will they get to getting away with it before the investigator gets involved and then catches them out. The specific non-linear narrative structure used here - in which the action starts with the crime then the timeline flashes back to before Charlie crosses paths with those events - could quickly get old if repeated consistently. (Unless, perhaps, the writers play around with some variations of it.) The show’s production has a retro feel, utilising seventies/eighties era colours and fonts for the credits, and a tendency to lean on in-camera or otherwise low-tech methods to add expressive visuals. For example, a youth’s alienation is flagged by shooting his point of view watching a flirting couple through the smudged pane of a frosted refrigerator door in a store. The success of the show will depend on how well it combines an ongoing arc for Charlie with standalone crime of the week stories. There is apparently a packed cast of name actors slated for future episodes. John Ratzenberger in episode two provides a solid but non-showy performance in a supporting role, while the casino boss in ep one gave Adrian Brody a chance to deliver a dense backstory in the enjoyable form of a rhythmically flowing yarn. So, the uses the guest cast are put to will probably vary. The mildly taxing screen time demands of setting up a new scenario in each episode lost them half a star. Otherwise episodes went down easy, combining humour and dramatic tension in clear and enjoyable ways. This is almost certainly a worthwhile series to follow.'), ('6', 'Quirky show. Lead actress takes some getting used to, but ok. Plots are kind of thin sometimes but ok other times. A Columbo structure (we know who did it up front) while she solves the crime. Kind of stupid that she puts herself in danger each show and escapes with great luck. We\'d rate it ""give it a try and you may like it.""'), ('6', 'Reminds me of the old Ellery Queen show where they gave you the clues and Jim Hutton would break the fourth wall and ask, “Have you solved it yet?” In this case they drop a heavy-handed, non sequitur clue you can only miss if not paying attention.
