This is the best film I have ever seen on the banality of evil, and on the effects of extreme compartmentalization on empathy. It is almost a negative of banal materialistic dreams, deformed, monstrous in plain daylight. It is about two stories, the one we hear and the one we see, in constant dialog and dissonance. It is gut wrenching, terrible and an essential watch.'), ('10', 'You just know when you are watching a Jonathan Glazer movie there is going to be a one of a kind experience, beautifully shot, and intensely thought provoking. All of which are true with this movie, And the way that it communicates the devastation of the holocaust through sound is entirely unique. It’s absolutely a movie that should be seen, but it’s not made for everyone.'), ('10', 'Each cut takes us deeper and deeper into the rhythms of a life that is defined by death; every shot may seem simple in isolation, but in total they amount to a foundational work that demands attention. Classifying The Zone of Interest as being just about the banality of evil is to merely scratch the surface.')]","[(10.0, '“To write poetry after Auschwitz is barbaric”, Theodor Adorno famously wrote.

Yet it does so with a bracing originality.'), (10.0, 'In some ways, the film resembles an abyss-black absurdist comedy sketch or a video art installation. It could be said that its sole observation is the continual co-existence of grotesque cruelty and blithe workaday life, but it makes that observation with such rigorous formal control and unblinking dedication that its power to shock never diminishes.'), (10.0, 'Glazer’s film is richly daring. It is both meticulous and brutal; aloof and involved; ferocious and cool.

More than any movie I’ve seen this year, or perhaps any year, The Zone of Interest leaves you pondering the magnitude of what the banality of evil has wrought — and the terrible, inconsolable void that it leaves behind.'), (10.0, 'This is a challenging and troubling film that asks a lot of the viewer, before sending them away with a great deal to consider. There won’t be many films this year that you’ll turn over more thoroughly in the hours, days, and weeks that follow.'), (10.0, ""Glazer – whose previous film was the brilliantly unsettling Under the Skin – replicates the characters' internal distance through the movie's images and sounds. The result is unsettling in the extreme.""), (10.0, 'It’s a work that forces you to reexamine how we’ve processed this chapter of history and restores a proper sense of ungraspable horror.'), (10.0, 'The point of this overwhelming film—that depraved insanity sometimes goes undetected because of its unexpected mediocrity—has a chilling impact that seems, in the terrifying power politics of our world today, more egregiously relevant than ever.'), (10.0, 'It’s a disturbing work, guided by a discomforting sense of immaculateness that chills the viewer. It is the sanitation the film performs, which speaks to the now, in a way few Holocaust films have done before.'), (10.0, 'The Zone of Interest is one of the most unsettling movies of the 21st century, stunningly relevant, invasive by design, lodging itself in your head as an unforgettable cinematic experience.'), (10.0, 'In his meticulous and harrowing film The Zone of Interest, writer-director Jonathan Glazer has found a way to convey evil without ever depicting the horror itself. But though it escapes our eyes, the horror assaults our senses in other, deeper ways.'), (10.0, 'It’s lacerating, a master class in how to show without showing.')]"

It's also refreshing to see an artist involved in every element of a show's production whereas she could surely pass a lot of duties to others.

Beyonce represents the American ethos of self-assured individualism about as well anyone in this film and it's hard to not feel that her approach to work sometimes veers into self-aggrandizement. It's wonderful to see the work of her many collaborators but did we also really need to see Beyonce overriding and belittling their advice? The implication in these sequences is that she is consistently combatting laziness, corner cutters and compromisers. She alone can do it. In the era of strongman politicians and megalomaniacal billionaires, is this really what we need to see?

Seeing this with my Mom, who I went to see Beyoncé with as well, was so important. The message about being a mom and being there for your children was so beautiful and made me so thankful that I got to experience this whole thing with my Mom. The editing and soundscape for this film was on a whole new level. The constant cuts to different outfits, the loud bass, and the hundreds of different camera angles made it a whole different experience compared to the concert.

This is the best work of Cillian Murphy, this is the best film biography that American cinema shot, this is one of the most unusual ways to tell the biography of a person in the film leading 3 parallel storylines. Oppenheimer is clearly not a movie for everyone and many will just find it boring. There's no action here, and most of the movie is dialogue. Also, the culmination of the film here is not the very fact of the creation of nuclear weapons by Openheimer, which was clearly expected by most viewers.

The constant back and forth between different parts of Oppenheimer's life assembles a dense narrative that unravels his moral dilemma or guilty conscious.

The loud and tiring soundtrack and diegetic sounds drown out any important dialogue; the pacing is messy; the theme is lackluster; overall, aside from two or three significant scenes, everything else about the film makes it a typical, shallow, prolific actor-filled attempt at something meaningful. Nolan does not have the insight or tools to make a historical film of this scale. His film adds nothing to the legacy of J. Robert Oppenheimer.'), ('10', 'I have been Nolan fan for a very long time and while not all of his movies click with me, this one is a masterpiece. Not every movie needs action, to be good.

Murphy embodies Oppenheimer\'s intellect and internal conflicts with remarkable depth, delivering a performance that is both captivating and emotionally charged. Supported by a stellar ensemble cast, including Emily Blunt and Michael Caine, the film excels in its portrayal of the interpersonal dynamics within the scientific community amidst the pressures of wartime.Nolan\'s direction elevates the storytelling, employing his signature nonlinear narrative style to unravel Oppenheimer\'s life, from his groundbreaking scientific discoveries to the moral quandaries he faced in the wake of his creation\'s catastrophic implications. The cinematography is stunning, seamlessly transitioning between the grandeur of scientific breakthroughs and the intimate struggles of the protagonist.While the film provides a compelling exploration of Oppenheimer\'s psyche and the moral dilemmas of scientific innovation, at times, the pacing feels slightly uneven, causing a brief detachment from the narrative flow.Overall, ""Oppenheimer"" is a thought-provoking cinematic experience that prompts reflection on the ethical responsibilities of scientific advancement.

I felt little emotional investment in the central couple due to the (mostly) generic script and story. To begin with, we are asked to believe this pair are destined for one another having only seen them play together as children, then have an inconsequential conversation about test scores. When they reconnect as adults, first on Skype, then later in person, their conversations are almost impossibly lacking in personality or spark, unless you count her remarking that midnight is a rather late time to have dinner. The rudimentary dialogue permeating the script, which offers so little dimensionality to the characters, does not make for compelling romantic chemistry. A scene where a romantic pairing silently enjoy one another's presence (here on a train) works in a film like 'Lost in Translation' because that film did the groundwork of developing their bond through rich and interesting conversations - and more varied situations - earlier on. This film has not earned that right due to its paper-thin sketch of their connection: if a script is going to consist 100% of talking, with absolutely *no* other types of scene or depiction of other shared experiences, then the dialogue needs to be a *lot* more interesting than this film has to offer. As sweet and mildly engaging as the performances were, the shortcomings in the writing left me wondering what Nora and Hae Sung saw in one another. In the final third, at least, the viewer’s patience is rewarded with some quite well-written scenes, such as the husband’s ‘meta’ speech about how he may ultimately play the loser in this particular love triangle. I also enjoyed the strange tension of the three characters out at a bar together, during which the husband is gradually phased out, first of the conversation, then the camera shot. But the forgettable, shapeless eighty minutes that preceded that final third had already done its damage by that point, limiting the impact of the potentially effective ending.

This film, on the other hand, could have been a Lifetime TV movie. The only watchable elements of the film are the performances from Teo Sue, who is incredible, and John Magaro as the husband. The supporting roles deserved a much better film.

Nora is twelve years old and has a crush on her classmate Hae Song. Unfortunately for the burgeoning romance, Nora’s parents have decided to leave Seoul and immigrate to Canada. Twelve years later, Nora and Hae Song reconnect through the miracle of social media. Their relationship becomes a series of video calls where the sense of connection is palpable. Eventually though, Nora decides that they should stop talking for a while; she wants to focus on career opportunities in her new home town of New York City. Another twelve years later, Hae Song decides to vacation in New York City. It’s an opportunity for him to see a now-married Nora face-to-face for the first time in twenty-four years. It’s all sweet, sad and thoughtful. In the process, this film offers more observations about the human condition than any film in recent memory. Several elements make this film outstanding. The cast is pitch perfect. As the adult Nora, Greta Lee (“The Morning Show,” “Russian Doll,” Will Aronson’s musical “My Scary Girl”) is mesmerizing. She blends her well-honed comic timing with a sincerity and vulnerability that are irresistible. As Hae Song, Teo Yoo (“Leto,” “Decision to Leave”) is equally impressive. You can often read his emotions without a word having to be spoken. John Magaro (“The Big Short,” “First Cow”) has a smaller but still essential role as Nora’s husband, Arthur. In one of the best film scenes in recent memory, Nora and Hae Song are in a bar speaking in animated Korean while Arthur sits patiently, uncomfortably beside her. Clearly, this is a film that could have gone in a million different directions. Song deftly uses her story to explore a variety of themes – the nature of relationships, the immigrant experience, the necessary balance between work and relationships, the role of fate (and the Korean concept of “in-yun”). She does it all in an unhurried style that makes “Past Lives” feel similar to Richard Linklater’s “Before” trilogy. It’s my guess this film will be equally well-loved and critically regarded. What’s most surprising here is Song’s self-confidence as a first-time filmmaker, given that she has the additional responsibility of being true to her own story. Many of the story elements of “Past Lives” are autobiographical. Song emigrated from Korea to Canada at age 12. She, like Nora, is a playwright. She currently lives in New York City with a husband she met on a writer’s retreat, like her character. Realizing and respecting the power of her story, Song infuses this film with an unhurried pace that allows real emotions to develop and well-earned insights to come to the surface. Song has the self-confidence to highlight the power of words left unspoken. She uses her technique to convey the insurmountable gulf between two characters who, paradoxically, are standing two feet apart. Like many of the best films, “Past Lives” will serve as an incentive for self-reflection for many moviegoers. You’ll leave the theater pondering the arc of your own story and the crucial “what-ifs” that have affected your own journey. “Past Lives” is a powerful, evocative experience for any moviegoer with a beating heart.'), ('8', 'One of the best films of year by a first-time director.

Carol as a protagonist is weak, but as you peel back the layers you get someone extraordinary in the mundane.

I was not prepared for a show with such genuine, complex, well-written, well-acted, believable, and sympathetic characters. Is it a comedy with tragic moments? Is it a tragedy with comedic moments? It works as both. I laughed consistently. I was nearly moved to tears on multiple occasions. The characters are nuanced, complex, and dynamic. The plot is an unpredictable rollercoaster but the surprising moments never feel unearned. Careful watchers will pick up on the foreshadowing along the way, yet I do not think even seasoned viewers will be able to guess how the story ends.
