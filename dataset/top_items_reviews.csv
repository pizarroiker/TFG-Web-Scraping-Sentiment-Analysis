From the moment the opening credits rolled, I was completely captivated by the sheer artistry displayed on screen. Beyoncé\'s vision shines through every frame, blending stunning visuals with powerful storytelling. Each scene feels like a carefully crafted work of art, drawing the audience deeper into the narrative with every passing moment. The cinematography is breathtaking, with every shot meticulously composed to evoke a sense of awe and wonder. But it\'s not just the visuals that make ""Renaissance"" a standout film it\'s the emotion behind every performance. Beyoncé delivers a tour de force performance, displaying a range and depth that left me spellbound. Her portrayal of the lead character is nothing short of mesmerizing, capturing the essence of strength, vulnerability, and resilience in equal measure. The soundtrack, as expected, is a highlight of the film, with Beyoncé\'s powerful vocals driving home the emotional beats of the story. Each song is expertly woven into the fabric of the narrative, enhancing the overall experience and leaving a lasting impact. But perhaps what impressed me most about ""Renaissance"" is its message of empowerment and self-discovery. Through the journey of the protagonist, Beyoncé explores themes of identity, authenticity, and the power of embracing one\'s true self. It\'s a message that resonates deeply and lingers long after the credits roll. In conclusion, ""Renaissance"" is a true masterpiece a triumph of artistry, storytelling, and pure talent. Beyoncé has once again proven herself to be a force to be reckoned with, and I can\'t wait to see what she has in store next.'), ('10', 'She did it again, just like homecoming, the execution of this film is spectacular, the editing, the behind the scenes, the vocals, the dancing, all perfection!

Beyonce crafted a concert film that is equally a documentary film.

I really enjoyed the behind-the-scenes footage too, it feels great seeing Beyoncé putting it all together, as the superior artist she is, while praising all the crew that worked so hard for this tour. They truly created a supermachine. It never stops to amaze me how she always comes up with new stuff and manages to top everything she has done before.

This documentary shows what's behind the magic of the album and the show that has the same name: RENAISSANCE""), ('6', ""Pretty conflicted on this. Beyonce's stamina and technical skills as a singer and dancer are beyond reproach and are fun to see. It's also refreshing to see an artist involved in every element of a show's production whereas she could surely pass a lot of duties to others. The sheer spectacle and fun of the concert comes to a grinding halt however during many of the documentary portions. Beyonce represents the American ethos of self-assured individualism about as well anyone in this film and it's hard to not feel that her approach to work sometimes veers into self-aggrandizement. It's wonderful to see the work of her many collaborators but did we also really need to see Beyonce overriding and belittling their advice? The implication in these sequences is that she is consistently combatting laziness, corner cutters and compromisers. She alone can do it. In the era of strongman politicians and megalomaniacal billionaires, is this really what we need to see? Beyonce addresses her take no guff attitude head one in at least one voiceover, saying it doesn't preclude empathy. Nice to hear but well it would been better to see, and maybe have the impression for at least a solitary moment that humility and accountability factored into the show and its music.""), ('10', ""Beyoncé continues to surpass expectations with each new project, and Renaissance Film by Beyoncé is a testament to her unrivaled excellence.

Her work ethic and attention to detail showcased throughout the WHOLE FILM was inspiring. This movie has everything; I laughed, was in awe, and even teared up at parts. The montage about UNCLE JOHNNY was so heartfelt and touching; the fact that he isn't on this earth to see what Beyoncé has created in his honor is heartbreaking. Seeing this with my Mom, who I went to see Beyoncé with as well, was so important. The message about being a mom and being there for your children was so beautiful and made me so thankful that I got to experience this whole thing with my Mom. The editing and soundscape for this film was on a whole new level. The constant cuts to different outfits, the loud bass, and the hundreds of different camera angles made it a whole different experience compared to the concert. It is obvious to me that Beyoncé is the greatest living entertainer of our time and that NO ONE is on her level. The fact that she was so involved in every single aspect of this tour and movie is so impressive. She truly created a film and tour that uplifts everybody and did it in a way that looks BREATHTAKING on screen and in person.

Oppenheimer,2023-07-21,movie,3 h,9.0,8.5,"{'Drama', 'History', 'Biography'}",8.6,"[('9', ""A great movie! The writing, art, music/sound design and acting was all amazing!!! It's a masterfully crafted film that will be remembered as one of the best historical films of our time.""), ('7', 'A good movie, but no action. The actors and dialogues are top notch. It was interesting to follow the plot until the last moment, especially now during the war between Ukraine and Russia, when not helping Ukraine from the whole world can lead to catastrophic consequences'), ('8', ""The film was really good; the whole plot was very interesting from the beginning to the end. Maybe there were two unnecessary scenes, but the overall quality was good. I enjoyed each actor's performance; they were amazing. the scene about the bomb was, in my opinion, the best. although I would have liked to have watched the rest of the part about the bomb exploding.""), ('10', 'Oppenheimer is a masterclass of art direction, storytelling, character portraying and soundtrack that culminates in an extraordinary movie.'), ('10', 'This is what exactly a big blockbuster in recent days. I have seen this film in my country\'s theater, BHD at Vincom Plaza Le Van Viet, Vietnam; and I watched through all three hours with no missing details. As a biographical thriller drama film, \'\'Oppenheimer\'\' is focused on the father of the atomic bomb, Robert Oppenheimer. While focused on his contribution to the atomic bomb in the Manhattan Project, the film also depicted his later life with his dramatic and tragic fall in 1954. Using color motion and black-and-white motion to tell the story through the film, I think this is Nolan\'s high-handed risk. But that doesn\'t make the plot and content of the movie any less interesting, it also increases the psychological drama moments for viewers. Nolan\'s screenplay and direction are ultra-brilliant, and I gave the plot and content 9/10. For the performances, the A-list Hollywood stars have brought to me and the world\'s audiences their super-excellent performance. Included here is Cillian Murphy, the Irish actor best known for his role as Tommy Shelby in Peaky Blinders. Throughout the film, his eyes, emotions, outfits, and charisma are perfect, and his psychological depth helps him completely immerse himself in this role. Others in the cast have done so well in the film, including ""Iron Man"" Robert Downey Jr. when he played Lewis Strauss, the arrogant businessman who wants to kick Oppenheimer out of the political issues. And the fact Downey and Murphy have won the Oscars has proven that they are worthy of what they represent in the film. I would give the score for acting 9/10. Other contributions, including Hoyte van Hoytema\'s excellent cinematography technique, Ludwig Goransson\'s brilliant score, and some stunning no-CGI visuals, further enhanced the artistic perfection of the film. 10/10 is the score I would give for the film\'s other contributions. Having won 7 Oscars at the 2024 Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Director, was a worthy achievement for the film crew, especially Nolan, who has now just won the first two Oscars in his career. Overall, \'\'Oppenheimer\'\' is a must-see film for all viewers with everything it has shown.'), ('10', ""Expect a thought-provoking drama that goes beyond wartime action. The movie explores the personal struggles of Oppenheimer and the lasting impact of his scientific achievements.

The sidecasting is something else, they hired real actors from each country based their nationallity and the best part was how accrurate it was, they even have easter eggs of the theorie, the people had back then. Oppenheimer was a cinematic masterpiece and has to be watched in cinema, but it has some flaws, that not everyone likes, like there was too many dialoge (personally liked it, but can understand why people dont) and that the aftermath of the explosion for japan werent shown, i think there is some policy about it that nolan can show the aftermath of it, but that would made the movie way better.'), ('10', ""This is a magnificent film, with perfect direction, an incredible script and phenomenal actors.

The film delves into humanity's fascination with destruction and our relentless pursuit to enhance the means to achieve it. Character study is pivotal to the success of Oppenheimer, and a brilliantly layered examination is present here. This movie is mostly about Oppenheimer, and Cillian Murphy is up to the task as he delivers a brilliant lead performance. Robert Downey Jr exceptionally complements Murphy with a final act that shows him at his best. Matt Damon, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh round up this stellar cast.

I never thought it possible that the story of this man, who gave the world its means of cataclysmic destruction, could be boring for such long stretches. Explosive scenes meant to show us the inside of Oppenheimer's mind simply didn't. And fancy cuts between time periods didn't make up for what amounts to a lack of substance and depth in the writing, especially the character work. We simply don't care enough, about Oppenheimer or secondary characters that, with the exception of Downey's, we can barely tell apart, i.e., the talking heads. Considering the subject, and this rich opportunity, that's a tragedy in itself. I know this director is worshiped for his cleverness with form, but I think he was the wrong choice for this material.

I gave up halfway through the movie because I was falling asleep every 10 minutes. An endless dialog between a multitude of characters who are neither properly introduced nor developed in any way, interrupted by constant flashbacks. Recurring, completely out of place CGI cutscenes, which I interpret as dreams of Oppenheimer and which hint at a physical background in an absolutely ridiculous way, such as trembling strings or flying particles. Nothing exciting happens, apart from constant chatter and endless discussions. The whole thing is paired with a pretty good pinch of American patriotism and whitewashing and justification of the past. The whole movie wants to suggest a significance and grandeur that it simply doesn't have.

All of Us Strangers,2023-12-22,movie,1 h 45 m,9.0,8.4,"{'Drama', 'Fantasy', 'Romance'}",8.6,"[('8', 'All Of Us Strangers ""All Of Us Strangers"" is a profound exploration of grief and human feelings. The story follows Adam, a lonely screenwriter, who begins a relationship with his neighbor. Meanwhile, Adam also experiences vivid visions in which he reconnects with his deceased parents. The storytelling in ""All Of Us Strangers"" is brilliant, as it deftly navigates a multitude of themes: loss and grief, sexuality, bullying, missed opportunities, closure, loneliness, mental illness, and depression. The film intertwines a dual narrative of a budding romance and Adam\'s reconnection with his deceased parents. The love story gradually fosters Adam\'s healing, helping him confront the long-standing pain of his parents\' loss. This relationship symbolizes hope, but the film delivers a gut-wrenching twist that takes it all away. The final sequence is both memorable and poignant, with a touch of beauty in the end shot, despite the surrounding pain. Adam must heal again, find hope anew, or possibly continue living through vivid visions and explorations. This is an intimate film with a small cast, and the performances are outstanding. Andrew Scott, Paul Mescal, and Jamie Bell all shine, but it was Claire Foy who left a lasting impression on me. Foy\'s performance is nothing short of phenomenal, and her scenes with Andrew Scott are the film\'s highlight. I could have watched the entire movie with just the two of them. Overall, ""All Of Us Strangers"" is a masterfully crafted film that explores complex emotions and themes with a memorable and heartbreaking conclusion that\'ll linger long after the credits roll. 8.5/10'), ('5', '(Mauro Lanari) ""The [healing or even salvific] Power of Love""? Starting over from my last review, Rimbaud, at whom his lover Verlaine had fired two pistol shots wounding him in the left wrist, wrote at the age of 19: ""L\'amour est à réinventer"". Unlike that young Frenchman of almost two centuries ago, Haigh has a much less mature and too melodramatic idea of lyricism, nor is he interested in abandoning lamentocracy to seek a new agapelogy even though the prerequisites for an unprecedented paradigm are available.'), ('1', 'I don’t know why people are pretending to love it. Beyond Andrew Scott’s acting, the rest of it was predictable, caricature-y, boring, lacking in emotion.'), ('10', 'One of the best movies I ever saw. Emotional and resonant. Exception performance by Andrew Scott.'), ('10', 'Such an intense and wonderful movie. Andrew Scott is incredible and he delivers a performance that was so overlooked by the award season. Amazing movie!'), ('10', 'Get the tissues out because you’re sure gonna need them. Heartbreaking, melancholic and devastating are just some of the words you’ll hear to describe All of Us Strangers and they’re all true because this film will hit you right in the feels. Adam (Andrew Scott) is a screenwriter living in London and begins a relationship with his mysterious neighbour Harry (Paul Mescal). Adam finds himself dwelling on memories of the past and is drawn back to his childhood home only to discover that his parents appear to be living just as they were on the day they died, 30 years before. Director Andrew Haigh has admitted this is his most personal film yet and wow does it show. Although an adaptation of the novel Strangers by Taichi Yamada, Haigh has definitely put his own stamp on this story. A beautifully told tale that tackles loneliness, grief, heartbreak and of course the power of love. It reaches a hand deep into your heart and will tear out a part of you that you may not have even known was there. No matter what stage of life you’re in All of Us Strangers will have a sincere impact because in some shape or form we’ve all dealt with loss and this film makes you reflect on what it means to lose someone and think back to all the things we might have said. Few films can really capture the human fear of loneliness that lies within each of us and All of Us Strangers puts it on display for all to see. Between Andrew Scott, Paul Mescal, Claire Foy and Jamie Bell, this film is a masterclass in acting and they will all break your heart. Andrew Scott particularly plays this part beautifully. Just give the man all the awards already because he certainly deserves them. All of Us Strangers is also a great example of how to use music to elevate your movie because the song choices were on point. The entire film has an eerily haunting and magical dreamlike quality, resulting in a completely enthralling story which will make you forget you’re watching a movie. Films that feel real and affect so many people will stand the test of time and All of Us Strangers is a powerful and emotional movie that will stay with you long afterwards, it’s a cinematic masterpiece. Look there’s only so many ways I can tell you how incredible this film is so what are you waiting for? The cinema awaits. You all know by now I don’t give 10/10 ratings easily, highly recommended for everyone.'), ('7', ""Better than I expected. Very heartfelt movie about love, loneliness, loss, and regret. It's about how we choose to share intimate stories about ourselves, and how we deal with our past. I cried a couple of times, so it got to me.""), ('10', ""Wow... I'm still feeling pretty numb from this one (in the best way possible.) I'm just going to come right out and say it: I honestly don't think a film has ever made me cry and sob as much or as hard as this one has. Even as I type this, I'm giving it everything I got to keep holding back the tears. In this absolute tearjerker of a film, lonely screenwriter Adam (Andrew Scott) living in solitude finds himself confronted with the potential for love when a drunken young man (Paul Mescal) stumbles upon his apartment one night. Through this encounter, he recalls his long-deceased parents (Jamie Bell and Claire Foy) while attempting to write about them and unexpectedly finds himself inexplicably face-to-face with them in his childhood home once again, granting him the chance to face them with his unspoken truths, sexual identity, and other things he wish he could've said to them. Directed by Andrew Haigh ('45 Years', 'Lean on Pete') and adapted from a Japanese novel titled 'Strangers', the trailer for this film alone left me a bawling mess, and I knew that this film was going to be something truly tender and special. This film explores so many universal truths and ideas about love, grief, what lies after, reconciliation, hope, and moving forward. Andrew Scott is an absolute revelation here. His aching and tender heart is reflected in his layered and nuanced performance here that feels all too raw and genuine. Alongside him is Paul Mescal (of last year's indie tearjerker 'Aftersun') as the romantic prospect that enters into Adam's life when he least expects it in an equally heartfelt performance. Claire Foy and Jamie Bell as Adam's deceased parents also turn in heartaching performances of their own. What's more, the film's story is beautiful, heartbreaking, and hopeful all in equal measure. But be forewarned, as if the majority of the film wasn't already emotionally devastating enough, the ending is an absolute gut-punch straight to the heart. This film DOES NOT ever let up or pull its emotional punches for even a second. Anyone with a pulse is bound to feel compelled to call their parents, loved one/significant other, family, etc. and tell them how much they love them. The first thing I did when I got home from this one (apart from being a sobbing, blubbering mess still) was hug each and every one of my family members to tell them how much I love them. It also had me thinking of my recently-deceased Grandpa Tyler the entire time I watched it. I felt his love and presence shine through virtually every last scene and frame of this film. If that isn't a true testament to the power of this film, then what is!? Overall, gorgeously acted and performed by its four stars, who commit themselves mind, body, and soul to the tender and universal themes of love, loss, grief/lamentation, loneliness, repressed identity, what-ifs, and hope/moving forward in life in the face of profound loss. It's quite possibly the most equally heartbreaking yet hopeful and life-affirming film I've ever seen. My rating: FIVE OUT OF FIVE STARS (the only five-star rating I've assigned to any film this year.)""), ('9', 'Love a film that keeps me interested and trying to second guess where it is headed. No spoilers from me but this had me hooked until the very last scene. Great performances from all.'), ('10', 'All of Us Strangers is a simple story about the impossibility of growing up completely, the hunger for connection and the profound beauty of unlikely soulmates coming together, underscored by brilliant cinematography and a rumbling soundtrack driving us to a finale that is startling, inevitable and exactly right.

I felt little emotional investment in the central couple due to the (mostly) generic script and story. To begin with, we are asked to believe this pair are destined for one another having only seen them play together as children, then have an inconsequential conversation about test scores. When they reconnect as adults, first on Skype, then later in person, their conversations are almost impossibly lacking in personality or spark, unless you count her remarking that midnight is a rather late time to have dinner. The rudimentary dialogue permeating the script, which offers so little dimensionality to the characters, does not make for compelling romantic chemistry. A scene where a romantic pairing silently enjoy one another's presence (here on a train) works in a film like 'Lost in Translation' because that film did the groundwork of developing their bond through rich and interesting conversations - and more varied situations - earlier on. This film has not earned that right due to its paper-thin sketch of their connection: if a script is going to consist 100% of talking, with absolutely *no* other types of scene or depiction of other shared experiences, then the dialogue needs to be a *lot* more interesting than this film has to offer. As sweet and mildly engaging as the performances were, the shortcomings in the writing left me wondering what Nora and Hae Sung saw in one another. In the final third, at least, the viewer’s patience is rewarded with some quite well-written scenes, such as the husband’s ‘meta’ speech about how he may ultimately play the loser in this particular love triangle. I also enjoyed the strange tension of the three characters out at a bar together, during which the husband is gradually phased out, first of the conversation, then the camera shot.

Loved it... and hats off to the main actor Koji Yakusho... amazing work.""), ('4', 'Films that feel like they\'re ""reaching"" in their attempts to make a statement can result in a frustrating watch, as is very much the case with the latest from acclaimed writer-director Wim Wenders. This character study about the life of a middle-aged public toilet cleaner in Tokyo (Koji Yakusho) follows him through his virtually unchanging daily routine of working, reading and taking nearly identical photos of trees. Even though there are minor differences in the events of his day-to-day life, much of his schedule is relentlessly the same, a comfortable yet mundane pattern that\'s cinematically repeated endlessly (and one can imagine what that does for holding viewer interest). He seems to purposely keep his life simple to avoid irritating complications, but that appears to be more of a way to stave off loneliness than to provide reassuring measures of certainty and predictability. He also appears to have undergone a painful (though largely unexamined) past that he\'s trying to escape, even though he clings to many elements that are rooted in that historical time frame (he listens to cassette tapes from the 1970s-80s, takes photos with a film camera, uses a flip phone and has little awareness about the internet). This lifestyle is presented as the source of some kind of supposedly profound wisdom, yet the insights that emerge from it are, quite frankly, innately simplistic (""the next time is the next time"" and ""now is now"" - truly deep principles, to be sure). As a consequence, all of this makes for a rather tedious watch, one filled with story threads that go largely unexplored and, ultimately, unresolved. To its credit, the film features some fine cinematography and an excellent soundtrack, and it grows progressively more engaging the further one gets into the story (when a story actually begins to develop out of a largely flatlined narrative). But, despite these assets, much of the picture\'s opening half is riddled with extraneous material that could have readily been pruned. In fact, the removal of that superfluous content could have easily reduced this work down to a more manageable extended short without losing anything, a change that would have yielded a more worthwhile viewing option. I\'m a longtime fan of Wenders\' work, but this offering just doesn\'t measure up to his past releases. It\'s also somewhat baffling how this production has garnered as much attention as it has, such as its selection as Japan\'s entry in the 2023 Academy Awards\' international film category, for which it garnered an Oscar nomination (amazingly beating out the far superior Japanese film ""Monster"" (""Kaibutsu"")), as well as Yakusho\'s best actor award at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival.

An ordinary guy going about his life and appreciating the little things, is at first (and for most of the film) inspiring, humorous and uplifting. How nice it is to watch a movie where the roof doesn’t cave in and turn into a drama fest. For me the ending was difficult to watch and the outro song kind of rubbed me like I was watching the ending to a completely other movie. While this film was unabashed in it’s exit, it just kind of killed it for me. Still a good film. A slow burn, which is a nice change of pace sometimes (and to fall asleep to). Far from a bad film. After leaving the film, I took a two hour walk because to go to a bar after watching something like this would be difficult for me. Still reflecting on it but I’m pretty sure to say I give it a 5/10 (irony)'), ('8', ""In this heartfelt little Japanese slice of life, Koji Yakusho plays a middle-aged janitor who goes about his day-to-day routine cleaning and sanitizing the public restrooms in the streets of Tokyo.

While it does feel a bit monotonous and repetitive at times, it is after all the whole point of the film, and shows that sometimes the simplest of lives and routines can be fulfilling in their own right.

He also revels in the beauty of trees and takes photos of them. As created by director Wim Wenders, the acts of mindfully appreciating details become a sort of meditation. The title refers to the Lou Reed song, which is about simple daily pleasures. While there's are some small story developments, the film is primarily a poetic ruination about appreciating life. Yakusho won Best Actor at Cannes, which is a challenge because he conveys little emotion during most of the film, but the powerful final close-up sums up his life and helps explains the Cannes recognition.

Though some of the show’s more elaborate jokes are strained, Beef otherwise has a taut, offbeat humor that distinguishes it from plenty of banally crude we-can-say-swears comedies that have clogged up premium cable and streaming services in the last ten years.'), (8.0, 'It’s a dark, existential thriller about cynical people confronting a deep sadness within. And this – despite several very funny lines of dialogue – doesn’t easily translate to light entertainment. Yet this Beef, when marinated in creator Lee Sung Jin’s unique perspective and tenderised by unexpected plot twists, soon becomes a delicacy worth savouring.'), (8.0, 'A story that’s full of drama and emotion, punctuated with moments of comedy that are truly dark.'), (7.8, 'The series is interested in serving up the fights viewers want to see, but it also peels back layers of the characters to ultimately reveal how similar Danny and Amy are. Whether it’s healthy for easily-triggered viewers to tune in to watch others get triggered, well, each viewer will have to decide on their own.'), (7.5, '“Beef” remains eminently watchable (so long as your nerves can tolerate such needlessly risky behavior) and its riveting performances make the five-plus hours a worthy investment. The limited series may jump the shark in its back half, but in doing so, it also mimics the contradictory emotions tied to its core conflict.'), (7.5, 'Just as it seems that Beef is going to go full misanthrope in its chaotic, surreal final episodes, the show pulls itself back from the brink of utter hopelessness at the end.'), (7.5, 'I respect “Beef” more than I enjoyed the experience of watching it, but it is wonderfully compelling.'), (7.4, 'Beef throws a lot of ideas at the wall to varying degrees of effectiveness, but it sticks its landing by reiterating its core theme, which is that life is hard and often terrible, and the most you can hope for is finding someone who really gets you despite it all.')]"

The opening scene features a spectacular SFX chase, but the subsequent action scenes are fast-paced, but not remotely as imaginative or impressive.

I get it\'s a show called ""American Born Chinese"", but there\'s better ways to handle the sensitive topic of racial identity and importance. The acting is sub-par. I didn\'t really feel very connected to the main protagonist or his companions by the end. There certainly isn\'t too much depth to the characters. However, there are enough obstacles for the team to overcome, such as family issues and self-confidence, which prevent some ""Gary Stu"" character. The EEAAO cast being present feels forced. While I welcomed Yeoh/Hsu/Quan on stage their screentime was limited, especially Hsu and Quan\'s which seemed like tertiary roles. This is unfortunate since they\'re some of the strongest actors in the cast. Quan talks a bit about the broken system of Hollywood for Chinese Americans, and it\'s one of the few conversations about race that actually land within the series; not focusing on some strawman racist, but a real, lived experience within the business and culture of Hollywood. Outside of this you\'re left with a mediocre but enjoyable fantasy story, with a bit of coming-of-age drama. It\'s fun and the fight scenes are well choreographed. I did feel drawn to watch the next episode when one finished, just to see how the story turned out. This will definitely be more popular in a younger audience. If you\'re an adult you will find a few parts preachy and annoying, but the underlying story of a fantasy world, building self-confidence, strong relationships, and dealing with home issues is well enough done for a single watch.

The first is that One Piece episodes have no business being as long as they are.'), (5.0, 'To an even greater extent than the Netflix “Cowboy Bebop,” the Netflix “One Piece” feels bland and generic. It may satisfy fans of the original who are happy to see events more or less faithfully replicated, but most of the verve and personality of the anime are gone, replaced by busyness, elaborate but uninteresting production design and — a sign of the times — an increased piety regarding the story’s themes of knowing and believing in yourself.'), (5.0, 'At its best, “One Piece” is a candy-colored confection with a childish glee to match its straightforward coming-of-age arc.

Where it fails, critically if not quite fatally — that is to say, it almost put me off but I did carry through — is with Luffy. .... He’s meant to be the spirit of the tale, but turns tiresome in human form.'), (3.5, '“One Piece” is based on one of the most popular manga series ever, with a quarter-century’s worth of history filling its sails.

Yes, the production values are top notch but the story itself, and Brie\'s portrayal of an oppressed female chemist with Aspergers is only going to appeal to a teeny tiny minority. I tried hard to power through but I could only skip to the final ep after watching the first. I thought maybe if the final ep was really good then I\'d go back to see how it led up to it, but no, the final ep was horribly boring too.

To make ends meet, she ends up hosting a cooking show with a scientific angle. Meanwhile, her Black neighbor (Aja Naomi King) comes up against racial issues. This look at 2 strong women defying 1950s mentality clearly makes a feminist statement, sometimes more than it resonates on a personal level. Larson crafts a character that's stern, serious and sometimes vulnerable, while Pullman's quietly charming portrayal creates lingering fond memories. King actually seems to embody the emotional angle more effectively. Their staunchness despite setbacks relays a sometimes-compelling feminist fantasy, but at other times the disjointed scenes seem more preachy than poignant.""), ('5', 'Based on the trailer, I expected an awards darling.
